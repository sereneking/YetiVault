# Shadow Assassin
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 316*  

A shadow assassin looks like an undead shadow (as described in the *Monster Manual*) that wields shortswords also made of shadow. It exists only to slay the living.

## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The assassin can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the assassin can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the assassin has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two Shadow Blade attacks.

***Shadow Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage. Unless the target is immune to necrotic damage, the target's Strength score is reduced by `1d4` each time it is hit by this attack. The target dies if its Strength is reduced to 0. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a shadow (see the Monster Manual) rises from the corpse `1d4` hours later.
