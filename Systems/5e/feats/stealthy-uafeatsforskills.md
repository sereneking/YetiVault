# Stealthy
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 4*  

You know how best to hide. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- If you are hidden, you can move up to 10 feet in the open without revealing yourself if you end the move in a position where you're not clearly visible.
