# Vegepygmy Scavenger
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 218*  

Vegepygmies rely on scavengers to salvage materials from their surroundings. Vegepygmy scavengers use stealth to bring food, tools, and weapons back to the colony. These scavengers leverage their nimbleness and natural camouflage to evade foes and pelt them with slings from the cover of leafy foliage.

## Vegepygmies

Also called mold folk, vegepygmies are fungal creatures that spring forth from the body of a Humanoid or Giant killed by russet mold, a poisonous fungus rumored to have originated from beyond the stars.

Vegepygmies gather in small bands, communicating with a combination of gestures, hisses, and rhythmic taps. While vegepygmies can sustain themselves by absorbing nutrients from soil and other organic matter, they prefer a carnivorous diet achieved through hunting and scavenging. Vegepygmies can live indefinitely so long as the climate remains hospitable to their fungal bodies.

To learn more about vegepygmies, see Monsters of the Multiverse.
