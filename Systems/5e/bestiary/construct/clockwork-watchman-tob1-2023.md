# Clockwork Watchman
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 64*  

*This mechanical being's body is composed of brass and iron, bedecked in a loose uniform of the city watch. Its movements are slow but steady.*

## Lightly Armored Servants

Clockwork watchmen are more solidly built versions of common clockwork scullions (servant creations in wealthy households that are incapable of combat). Proper clockwork watchmen are built with iron parts instead of tin and given keener senses. Many have small bits of armor covering their joints and vital parts.

## Constant Rounds

They endlessly patrol the city day and night, pausing only to receive maintenance and new boots.

## Shouts & Stutters

Their speech is slow and halting, but their distinctive shouts and whistles bring human guards at a run.

## Traits

***Construct Nature.*** The clockwork watchman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Immutable Form.*** The clockwork watchman is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The clockwork watchman has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Halberd.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Net Cannon (4/Day).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, range 10/20 ft., one target. *Hit:* If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A mechanism within the clockwork watchman's chest can fire a net with a 20-foot trailing cable anchored within the watchman's chest. A creature, including the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature, can take its action to free the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature by succeeding on a DC 10 Strength check. Alternatively, dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the creature.
