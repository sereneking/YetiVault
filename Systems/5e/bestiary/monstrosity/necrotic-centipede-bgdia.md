## Traits

***Necrotic Body.*** A creature that touches the centipede or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`6d10 + 7`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the centipede can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The centipede makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the centipede, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the centipede's turns.

If the centipede takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the centipede must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the centipede. If the centipede dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
