**Sapphire Dragon Personality Traits**

`dice: [](creating-a-sapphire-dragon-sapphire-dragon-personality-traits-ftd.md#^sapphire-dragon-personality-traits)`

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I often fixate on specific historical battles or wars and won't rest until my hoard contains that conflict's most significant artifacts. |
| 2 | I am constantly aware of a call from beyond this world. I must prepare to answer that call by amassing powerful arms and armor. |
| 3 | I secretly look forward to adventurers trying to infiltrate my lair. How else could I try out new defenses? |
| 4 | Give me a storied helmet or scimitar over a pile of gold any day. |
| 5 | No creature can outsmart my defenses—if they do, they obviously cheated. |
| 6 | Any creature that can hold their own against me must teach me how—whether they want to or not. |
| 7 | I cannot resist a game of dragonchess—which, I will have you know, my ancestors probably invented. |
| 8 | The sight of blood makes me queasy. |
