| dice: d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | You're associated with the Gatekeepers, and you're on a quest to combat a daelkyr-related threat beyond the bounds of the Shadow Marches. |
| 2 | House Tharashk recruited you from the Marches to serve as a mercenary in the Last War. |
| 3 | You're a simple hunter, but you've decided to seek your fortune or a real challenge in the world beyond the Marches. |
| 4 | Your village was destroyed by monsters from Droaam, so you're looking for a new place in the world. |
| 5 | As a cultist of the Dragon Below, you believe that slaying powerful foes is the only way to earn your passage to the paradise that lies deep within the hollow world. You've ventured beyond the Marches in search of worthy enemies. |
| 6 | Your clan works with House Tharashk, and you've been recruited as a bounty hunter or investigator even though you're not a member of the house. |
| 7 | The leader of your clan committed a great wrong against another clan, which has now sworn to exterminate every last member of your clan. What better time to see the world? |
| 8 | Your work as an investigator has set you upon a trail of mysteries that leads far beyond the Marches. |
