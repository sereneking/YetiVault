|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [veteran](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) bargains with Erebos to allow him to remain in the living world as a Returned in exchange for a steady stream of mortal sacrifices. |
| 2 | A prominent [knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md) of another god loses their entire family, then publicly turns to Erebos in hopes of being reunited with loved ones in the Underworld. |
| 3 | An [acolyte](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/acolyte.md) convinces Erebos to bring her murdered daughter back to life, but the daughter is restored as a potent Returned who now terrorizes the polis. |
| 4 | A wealthy [noble](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) drives tenants out of a poor part of a polis so he can build a temple to Erebos. |
| 5 | The queen of a remote settlement prays to Erebos for endless treasure, and Erebos "blesses" her by turning the nearby river to liquid silver. The tyrant is delighted, but everyone else in her domain suffers. |
| 6 | A [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Erebos terrorizes a village, convinced that a particular Returned has taken refuge there. |
