# Felidar
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 23*  

Standing fully ten feet high at the shoulder, the great cats called felidars are noble, fierce beasts charged with white mana. Felidars consent to be ridden only by knights they consider virtuous. The crystalline horns rising from a hard plate on their foreheads glow with white or golden light when they spring into battle, sometimes brightly enough to blind their foes.

In game terms, a felidar is similar to a [unicorn](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/unicorn.md), with changes that reflect its feline nature.
