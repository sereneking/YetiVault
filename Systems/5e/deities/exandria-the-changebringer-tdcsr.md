Also known as "She Who Makes the Path," the Changebringer champions freedom, travel, trade, and adventure across the lands. Her will heralds open frontiers, and her call beckons her followers to discover that which awaits them beyond the known. There are few urban temples dedicated to the Changebringer, but her shrines are often found along well-traveled roads and on isolated wilderness hill-tops. Many merchants, adventurers, and free-spirited folk worship the Changebringer, and many a gala toast and tavern song celebrate her as a bringer of luck and fortune.

## Depiction

She is often depicted as a young woman of dark complexion and long, light brown hair that cascades to form the road left behind her. Most art shows her in constant motion, ever leading into the unknown.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Changebringer's clerics are granted powers of Moon, Nature, or Trickery.

## Holy Day

The Changebringer's holy day, called New Dawn, takes place on the first day of the first month, when the old year gives way to the new. In "Emon", the day of New Dawn is celebrated with a grand midnight feast that commonly features a short play celebrating the changes of the past year.

- Luck favors the bold. Your fate is your own to grasp, and to do so is to have the Changebringer behind you.  
- Change is inevitable. The righteous can ensure that such change is for the better.  
- Rise up against tyranny. Fight for the freedom of yourself and others when you can, and inspire others to fight when you cannot.
