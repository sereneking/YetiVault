# Zargash
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 223*  

Zargash worships Orcus, the Demon Prince of Undeath, who has promised to transform Zargash into a vampire after a lifetime of faithful service. For a living priest to worship Orcus is utter folly, but Zargash is twisted beyond any hope of redemption. His hobbies include slaying the living and animating the dead.

## Traits

***Cling to Life (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** The first time Zargash would drop to 0 hit points as a result of taking damage, he instead drops to 1 hit point.

***Special Equipment.*** Zargash wears a bat-shaped amulet that has the properties of a [ring of feather falling](/Systems/5e/items/ring-of-feather-falling.md).

***Spellcasting.*** Zargash casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**At will**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md), [thaumaturgy](/Systems/5e/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1/day each**: [command](/Systems/5e/spells/command.md), [gaseous form](/Systems/5e/spells/gaseous-form.md), [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [silence](/Systems/5e/spells/silence.md), [speak with dead](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-dead.md)

## Actions

***Warhammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, or 7 (`1d10 + 2`) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands.

***Deathly Ray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 25 (`4d10 + 3`) necrotic damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Animate Corpse (1/Day).*** Zargash targets the lifeless corpse of one Humanoid he can see within 30 feet of him and commands it to rise, transforming it into a zombie under his control. The zombie takes its turn immediately after Zargash. Animating the zombie requires Zargash's [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell). The zombie reverts to an inanimate corpse after 10 minutes, when it drops to 0 hit points, or when Zargash's [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends.
