# Ruin Spider
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 182*  

The potent magic of a Deck of Many Things can have unpredictable effects on its environment, especially when the deck remains in one place for a long time.

Ruin spiders arise when the magic of the deck transforms giant spiders into even more dangerous monsters whose acidic venom disintegrates everything it touches. A ruin spider is easily recognizable by anyone familiar with the Deck of Many Things because the pattern on the back of the cards is duplicated on the spider's carapace.

## Traits

***Ruinous Acid.*** Any nonmagical weapon that hits the spider corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the spider is destroyed after dealing damage.

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spider makes two Ruinous Bite attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Web.

***Ruinous Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage and 9 (`2d8`) acid damage. In addition, if the target is a creature wearing nonmagical armor, the armor takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an Armor Class of 10 is destroyed.

***Web (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. As an action, a [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can make a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a successful check. The webbing can also be destroyed (AC 10; 5 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to acid, bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
