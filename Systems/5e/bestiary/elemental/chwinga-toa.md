# Chwinga
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 216*  

A chwinga (pronounced cheh-WING-ah) is a tiny elemental spirit that lives in plants, rocks, and rivers far from civilization. Painfully shy, chwingas prefer to move about unseen.

If two or more chwingas live in the same area, each one will take shelter in a different plant, rock, or body of fresh water. Though no two chwingas look exactly alike, they resemble 6-inch-tall animated dolls with strange masks, spindly limbs, and wild hair. Their appearance is sometimes foreshadowed by cool breezes, the sweet smell of flowers, and dancing fireflies. Their mere presence makes a natural setting more lush and vibrant.

## Humanoid Fascination

Chwingas shun most other creatures, but they find the trappings of civilization fascinating. They puzzle over creatures that wear armor, carry weapons, use tools, and cook food. When a chwinga encounters one or more humanoids, its curiosity sometimes gets the better of it, and it shadows those creatures for a short time to observe them. If it takes a liking to a particular humanoid, a chwinga might use its cantrips to aid it, or might bestow a magical gift before departing. The features that attract a chwinga to a particular humanoid can vary. In some cases, a chwinga might simply like the way a humanoid walks or the way it combs its hair. Other times, it might be smitten by a humanoid's ability to play music or to eat copious amounts of food.

## Elemental Nature

Chwingas sleep but don't require air, food, or drink. They don't have names and have no ability to speak. When a chwinga dies, it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a marble of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water.

## Traits

***Unusual Nature.*** The chwinga doesn't require air, food, or drink. When it dies, it turns into a handful of flower petals, a cloud of pollen, a stone statuette resembling its former self, a tiny sphere of smooth stone, or a puddle of fresh water (your choice).

***Evasion.*** When the chwinga is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The chwinga's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material or verbal components:

**At will**: [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md), [guidance](/Systems/5e/spells/guidance.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [resistance](/Systems/5e/spells/resistance.md)

## Actions

***Magical Gift (1/Day).*** The chwinga targets a humanoid it can see within 5 feet of it. The target gains a supernatural charm of the DM's choice. See "chapter 7" of the Dungeon Masters Guide for more information on supernatural charms.

***Natural Shelter.*** The chwinga magically takes shelter inside a rock, a living plant, or a natural source of fresh water in its space. The chwinga can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect while inside this shelter, and the shelter doesn't impair the chwinga's blindsight. The chwinga can use its action to emerge from a shelter. If its shelter is destroyed, the chwinga is forced out and appears in the shelter's space, but is otherwise unharmed.
