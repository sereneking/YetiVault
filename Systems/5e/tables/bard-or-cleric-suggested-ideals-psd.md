# Bard or Cleric; Suggested Ideals
*Source: Plane Shift: Dominaria p. 18* 

**Suggested Ideals**

`dice: [](bard-or-cleric-suggested-ideals-psd.md#^suggested-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Self-Reliance.** I don't wear or use anything I haven't made myself. You can't count on anyone else in this world. |
| 2 | **Future.** I believe a true Twilight still awaits the Keldon faithful, when our fallen heroes will rise up to fight alongside us as we conquer the world. |
| 3 | **Pragmatism.** No ancestors are coming to save usâ€”we are our only hope. |
| 4 | **Coin.** I will happily fight for those too weak to defend themselves, if they pay me enough. |
| 5 | **Freedom.** The so-called "new Keld" is too safe, too controlled. The fire in Keldon blood demands warfare and pillage. |
| 6 | **Keld.** I am Keldon, and that is all that matters. I seek the glory and prosperity of my people above all else. |
