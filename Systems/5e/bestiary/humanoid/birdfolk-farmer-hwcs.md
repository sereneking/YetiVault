# Birdfolk Farmer
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 190*  

Simple farmers can be found across the Wood, providing necessary food and supplies to the cities. There are many places in Humblewood where digging up large heaps of soil would either be impractical or damaging to the forest. While traditional farms exists in Humblewood, the majority of farms are built in the canopies in or around cities. Farming in the canopy consists of growing flowering

moss gardens or fruit-bearing vines on the branches of perch trees. Canopy farms can also include the raising of large insects for food, or silkworms for clothing.
