| dice: d8 | Torment |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The Darklord is obsessed with music, their body warping to embody whatever song they hear. |
| 2 | The Darklord is transforming into a long-extinct being or something from the far-flung future. |
| 3 | The Darklord sees multiple dimensions at once and is going blind from their incandescence. |
| 4 | The Darklord is haunted by otherworldly masters that whisper from reflective surfaces. |
| 5 | The Darklord incubates something within them, an entity that slowly eats through their skin. |
| 6 | The Darklord is emptying of their own thoughts and filling with the voices of their scrolls. |
| 7 | The Darklord randomly screams their masters' words, messages that etch upon stone and flesh. |
| 8 | Any object the Darklord sees is drained of all but one portentous color. |
