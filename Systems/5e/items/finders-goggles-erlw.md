# Finder's Goggles
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Finding)*  


The lenses of these garish goggles are carved from Siberys dragonshards. While wearing these lenses, you gain the following benefits:

- When you make a Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check, you can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the check.  
- As an action, you can use the goggles to examine an object to identify the aura of the last creature that touched it. Make a Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check against a DC of 13 + the number of days since the last contact occurred. On a success, you learn the creature's type and can immediately use the goggles to cast [locate creature](/Systems/5e/spells/locate-creature.md) to find that creature. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
