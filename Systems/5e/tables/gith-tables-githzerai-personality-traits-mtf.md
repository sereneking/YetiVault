| 1 | All energy must be expended to a useful end. Frivolity is the first step to defeat. |
| 2 | Patience in all things. The first step in any venture is the most treacherous. |
| 3 | Emotions are a trap, meant to weaken the intellect and disturb the nerves. Pay them no heed. |
| 4 | Begin only those tasks you will finish. Strike only that which you will kill. |
