| dice: d8 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You heard a rumor once that signing a contract with your off hand is technically nonbinding, and you're desperate to see if it's true. For reasons. |
| 2 | All businesses have their ups and downs, but there's always money to be made from "processing fees." |
| 3 | You have a habit of always being clear about what you've promised, but never saying when you'll do it. |
| 4 | You love doing decorative scrollwork on documents, knowing that's the best place to hide the fine print. |
| 5 | As a child, you learned to cross your fingers behind your back when making a promise. Now you yearn to make that legally binding. |
| 6 | Your habit of screaming, "No take backs!" after any group decision seemed to suggest your true calling. |
| 7 | You believe that language is an art, not a science. Who's to say what is or isn't a "real" word? |
| 8 | The smell of old parchment makes you giddy. |
