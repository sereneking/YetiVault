# Keenness of the Stone Giant
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 18*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the physical talents emblematic of stone giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Cavernous Sight.** You gain [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) from another source, its range increases by 60 feet.  
- **Stone Throw.** As a bonus action, you can take a rock and make a magical attack with it. The attack is a ranged spell attack with a range of 60 feet that uses the ability score you increased with this feat as the spellcasting ability. On a hit, the rock deals `1d10` force damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the spellcasting ability modifier) or have the prone condition. You can use this bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
