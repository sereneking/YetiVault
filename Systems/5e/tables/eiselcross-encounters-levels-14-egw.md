**Eiselcross Encounters: Levels 1–4**

`dice: [](eiselcross-encounters-levels-14-egw.md#^eiselcross-encounters-levels-14)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters encounter `1d4` wildfolk [scouts](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md) hunting a [saber-toothed tiger](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/saber-toothed-tiger.md). The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition. |
| 2 | The characters encounter a lost Cerberus Assembly [mage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md) trying to return to Balenpost. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of Aeor, and there is a 50% chance chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item. |
| 3 | The characters find a [griffon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next `1d10` days. |
| 4 | The characters encounter the [revenant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/revenant.md) of a dead explorer from Balenpost who was murdered by one of its team and is looking for vengeance. |
| 5 | The characters find a 3-foot-tall, 50-pound egg. If they keep the egg in a cold environment for `1d10` weeks, a [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) hatches from it. |
| 6 | A [young remorhaz](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/young-remorhaz.md) ambushes the characters. |
