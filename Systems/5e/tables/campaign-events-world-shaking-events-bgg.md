|----------|-------|
| 1 | A giant who claims prophetic inspiration from Annam unites scattered bands of giants into a powerful political and militaristic force. |
| 2 | The death of a storm giant sets off a wide-ranging struggle among various giant leaders to fill the resulting power vacuum. |
| 3 | A cataclysmic disaster (such as a volcanic eruption, unending winter, or relentless storm) displaces both giants and smaller folk from their homes; only later do adventurers discover giants caused the disaster. |
| 4 | A mighty army led by giants launches an invasion of its neighbors, secretly motivated by the desire to access an ancient ruin in neighboring territory. |
| 5 | Humanoids mobilize to overthrow their giant oppressors, but the Humanoids are hopelessly outmatched in battle. |
| 6 | One of the giants' organizations described in "chapter 2" is founded or comes to this world for the first time. |
| 7 | A group of giants sailing in enormous boats makes landfall in an area inhabited by Humanoids, marking each people's first awareness of the other and the lands they inhabit. |
| 8 | A small but growing number of giants believe the adventurers might be the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy that means they will bring about the return of Annamâ€”and either the downfall or the resurgence of the giants. |
