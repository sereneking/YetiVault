# Lich Troll

## Salvage

Someone who has proficiency with jeweler's tools or woodcarver's tools can fashion the skull of a lich troll into a ring of regeneration. Doing so takes materials worth 5,000 gp, 10 days of work, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence or Wisdom check. Somebody must also cast greater restoration on the ring each day during the process. If the ring's wearer dies while wearing the ring, the soul of the lich has a 25 percent chance to take over the corpse and use it as a new body. But if the ring is created entirely in the area of a hallow spell with the everlasting rest effect, the tie to the lich's soul is broken

## Lore

- **DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** The lich troll is remnants of early attempts of powerful spellcasters to transfer their souls into trolls.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** The lich troll is immune to poison and resistant to necrotic damage. It regenerates and can be killed only by acid, fire, or radiant damage
