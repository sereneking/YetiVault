**Gold Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-gold-dragon-gold-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^gold-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Foresight. Righteous action requires carefully weighing potential consequences to ensure the cure is not worse than the disease. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Restraint. I cannot right every wrong. I encourage others to solve their own problems, and I save my strength for tribulations only I can address. (Any) |
| 3 | Stewardship. I do not serve individuals, but rather history. By acting strategically, I tip the ultimate balance toward justice and virtue. (Good) |
| 4 | Objectivity. I remain impartial in my judgments and refuse to let personal feelings get in the way of what's fair or necessary. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Isolation. Every interaction has ramifications that stretch on into infinity. I curate my impact on the world by remaining aloof and self-reliant. (Any) |
| 6 | Sovereignty. Other creatures lack my wisdom and must be controlled to prevent wrongdoing. (Evil) |
