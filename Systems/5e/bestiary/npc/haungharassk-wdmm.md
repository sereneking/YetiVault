## Traits

***Salt Sensitivity.*** A pound of salt thrown onto the snail's skin deals `1d6` acid damage to the creature.

***Magical Properties.*** A creature that uses an action to touch the living snail gains 6 temporary hit points that last for 24 hours. Any creature or object that touches the living snail also gains the benefit of a [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell. The snail loses these magical properties if it dies.

***Spider Climb.*** The snail can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
