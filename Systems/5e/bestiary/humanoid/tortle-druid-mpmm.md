# Tortle Druid
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 244, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 242*  

Many tortles view the world as a place of wonder. They live for the chance to hear a soft wind blowing through trees, to watch a frog croaking on a lily pad, or to stand in a crowded marketplace. A tortle druid savors such things more than most, channeling the natural magic of the world around them.

## Tortles

Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like bipeds with shells that cover most of their bodies. Because they carry their homes on their backs, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.

Most tortles like to see how other folk live. A tortle can spend decades away from their native land without feeling homesick, often viewing their current companions as their family.
