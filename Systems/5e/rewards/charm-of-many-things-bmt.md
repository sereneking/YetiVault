# Charm of Many Things

You are infused with a burst of magic from a [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md). As an action, you can touch a willing creature other than yourself and bestow the effect of a single randomly determined card from the deck upon the target. Once you use this charm, it vanishes from you.
