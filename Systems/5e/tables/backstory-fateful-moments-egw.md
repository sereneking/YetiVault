| 2 | You met a dark elf dying in the wilderness. Around their neck was a silver talisman containing a cameo of their child and the name "Il'viranya." It is an [amulet of proof against detection and location](/Systems/5e/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location.md). |
| 3 | A mysterious stranger gave you a gift that saved your life while you were lost in the wilderness. Roll on the "Ally and Rival Identities table" to determine the identity of the stranger. Then roll on [Magic Item Table B](/Systems/5e/tables/magic-item-table-b.md) in the "Dungeon Master's Guide" to determine the item. If you roll a consumable item from the table, roll again. |
| 4 | You were caught in a terrible storm but miraculously survived. Now your dreams contain visions sent by a mysterious god or demigod. You have proficiency in the [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion) skill (your choice). |
| 5 | A famous warrior trained you with what has become your signature weapon. You have proficiency with a martial weapon of your choice, and you own one such weapon. It has special features as detailed in "chapter 7" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". You also have the [Martial Adept](/Systems/5e/feats/martial-adept.md) feat from the "Player's Handbook". |
| 6 | You were the sole survivor when a horde of rampaging monsters raided your village or your neighborhood. You have proficiency in the [Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth) skill or proficiency with martial weapons (your choice). |
| 7 | A famous mage saw potential in you and tutored you in the arcane arts. You have a spellbook and the [Magic Initiate](/Systems/5e/feats/magic-initiate.md) feat from the "Player's Handbook". |
| 8 | While on a long journey, you were picked up by a traveling circus, spending a year with them before returning to your home. You have proficiency in the [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance) skill (your choice) and proficiency with the disguise kit. |
| 9 | You were transformed into a bear by mysterious magic, and lived for a year as an animal before you were saved by a druid. Magic still lingers within you, though, and you can cast [speak with animals](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-animals.md) at will. |
| 10 | You were press-ganged into military service, and were left shaken by what you saw on the battlefield. You have proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons.

| 12 | You were visited by a demon lord in a dream. You awakened knowing the [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md) spell and are now able to cast it as a ritual, but your familiar always takes the form of a [quasit](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md). You also have a random form of indefinite madness, determined by rolling on the [Indefinite Madness table](/Systems/5e/tables/indefinite-madness.md) in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide". |
| 13 | While exploring a remote forest, you were attacked by evil lycanthropes but escaped before being killed. You are cursed with [wereboar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wereboar.md), [wererat](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md), or [werewolf](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/werewolf.md) lycanthropy (DM's choice). |
| 14 | While lost in a remote forest or jungle, you were saved by a [werebear](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/werebear.md) or [weretiger](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/weretiger.md) (DM's choice). The lycanthrope believed you were destined for greatness and granted you the gift of lycanthropy with your consent. |
| 15 | You saved a pseudodragon from being eaten by a giant spider in a dark forest. The [pseudodragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md) now loyally follows you wherever you go, even if you'd rather it stay hidden. It is controlled by the DM but obeys your commands if treated well. |
| 16 | You nearly died from a virulent disease (the DM's choice of cackle fever, sewer plague, or sight rot; see "chapter 8" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Your life was saved by an agent of the Cobalt Soul, who could not cure the disease, but who gave you a [periapt of health](/Systems/5e/items/periapt-of-health.md) that suppresses it. |

| 19 | While reading through a mysterious tome once owned by your parent, you found a treasure map that points toward a place in Wildemount of the DM's choice. |
| 20 | You received a letter revealing that you were the secret child of a wealthy noble family living in Rexxentrum within the Dwendalian Empire. They enclosed 100 gp to ensure your safe passage to the imperial capital, and a signet ring bearing your true family's seal. |
