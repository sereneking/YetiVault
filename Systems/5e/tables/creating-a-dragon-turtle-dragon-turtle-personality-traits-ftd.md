**Dragon Turtle Personality Traits**

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I speak slowly and deliberately, pausing to reflect after (or sometimes in the middle of) each utterance. |
| 2 | I am more interested in the shiny baubles people carry than in anything they have to say. |
| 3 | I think of ships as kindred spirits and like to rub affectionately against their keels. |
| 4 | I like to show visitors the vastness of my domain, so they appreciate how insignificant they are. |
| 5 | I attack anyone I notice taking from the sea's bounty without offering something in return. |
| 6 | I think of sailors' songs as their "water speech" and try to converse with them by humming snippets of tunes I have overheard. |
| 7 | I swim alongside ships sailing through my domain, just out of arrow range, so they know I am watching. |
| 8 | I am fascinated by the politics of surface realms and talk endlessly with sailors and adventurers to stay current on the latest happenings on land. |
