**Sigil Market Ward Encounters**

`dice: [](sigil-market-ward-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-market-ward-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [Transcendent Order instinct](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/transcendent-order-instinct-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") asks to spar with the characters, promising a reward if the character wins the fight. |
| 2 | A neutral good [manticore](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/manticore.md) acupuncturist brushes past the characters, accidentally poking one of them with its spiny tail. As a token of apology, the manticore gifts the party a voucher for one free spa treatment at the Flame Pits (see the ""Market Ward Locations"" section). |
| 3 | Wheeze Whistletooth, a [night hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) with a persistent hacking cough, offers the party free samples of her famous mystery meat pies. |
| 4 | Clearly troubled, a human [commoner](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) in the Free League asks the party which faction, if any, they believe is right about the truths of the multiverse. |
| 5 | Two [Harmonium peacekeepers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/harmonium-peacekeeper-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") question the characters about the whereabouts of a red-furred bariaur who reportedly stole a [potion of invisibility](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-invisibility.md) from an alchemical shop. |
| 6 | A tiny copper soldier fashioned by a [pentadrone](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/pentadrone.md) toymaker marches up to the party, salutes them, and then stops functioning. |
| 7 | A [hill giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) stumbles toward the characters, pointing at his throat in worry but not saying a word. He's choking on an entire spit-roasted hog. |
| 8 | Disguised as Rowan Darkwood, a [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) mastermind attempts to recruit the characters with a lucrative opportunity: robbing the Bank of Abbathor (see the ""Market Ward Locations"" section). |
