| 3 | The incarnation knows their true nature and has weaponized their blood with poison that will put Strahd to sleep for a generation. |
| 4 | The incarnation seeks to resurrect a historic figure to battle Strahd, perhaps Sergei von Zarovich, the first Tatyana, or another enemy of the count. |
| 5 | The incarnation has located a relic that can weaken Strahd. However, they need the heroes to recover the item while they distract the count. |

| 7 | The incarnation has joined the "Keepers of the Feather"* and seeks to organize a siege of Castle Ravenloft. |
