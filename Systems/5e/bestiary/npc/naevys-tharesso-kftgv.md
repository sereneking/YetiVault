## Traits

***Brave.*** Naevys Tharesso has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Naevys Tharesso makes two melee attacks.

***Flame Tongue Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) slashing damage, or 7 (`1d10 + 2`) slashing damage if used with two hands. The knight can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword's command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until she uses a bonus action to speak the command word again or until she drops or sheathes the sword.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+2` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, Naevys Tharesso can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand Naevys Tharesso. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Naevys Tharesso is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Naevys Tharesso adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Naevys Tharesso must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
