# Shadow Dragon

## Lair actions

### Additional Lair Action

Shadow dragons have access to the lair actions usable by untransformed dragons of the same kind. The effects of these actions might be cosmetically altered, seeming darker, gloomier, and more subdued. They might also deal necrotic damage instead of other damage types. At your discretion, a legendary (adult or ancient) shadow dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Banish Light.** Any nonmagical source of illumination within a 60-foot-radius sphere centered on the dragon is snuffed out, and any spell that creates light within that same area is dispelled.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

When a shadow dragon establishes a lair on the Material Plane, the region around the lair takes on some of the characteristics of the Shadowfell, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Brooding Despair.** Creatures within 1 mile of the dragon's lair that have an Intelligence score of 5 or higher feel forlorn and hopeless.  
- **Dying Light.** Light is diminished within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, lightly obscuring the land in gloomy shadows.  
- **Gloomy Portals.** Some caves, caverns, pits, and other places of deep gloom within 1 mile of the dragon's lair form portals to the Shadowfell, allowing creatures from that plane to dwell nearby.
