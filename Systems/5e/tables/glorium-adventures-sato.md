**Glorium Adventures**

`dice: [](glorium-adventures-sato.md#^glorium-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The town's deceased warriors rise to fight again as [ghosts](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghost.md), but their resurgence creates headaches when the spirit of Flatnose Grim expects to be reinstated as the town's ruler. |
| 2 | After an argument with Tyrza, Jek Thanol refuses to shield Glorium from the armies of Gzemnid. With their treaty shattered, a [death tyrant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/death-tyrant.md) attacks the gate-town. |
| 3 | A [frost giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) jarl learns of the entrance to the World Tree within "Serpent's Rise". Rather than attack Glorium, he sets out to find the root and use it to conquer untold worlds. |
| 4 | A [sea hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) in the "Sacred Well" tells one of the characters they will die at the hand of Gzemnid in five days. |
