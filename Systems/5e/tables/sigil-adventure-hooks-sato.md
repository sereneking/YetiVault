| dice: d10 | Adventure Hook |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | A lost soul asks the party to escort them to the home of their deity—who no one's ever heard of. |
| 2 | A barrister begs the characters to serve as witnesses during a trial in the "High Courts", but the characters have no memory of witnessing a crime. |
| 3 | A [cranium rat squeaker](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/cranium-rat-squeaker-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") with an important secret needs help avoiding foes and finding its swarm elsewhere in Sigil. |
| 4 | Refugees entreat the characters to help them find a safe new home in Sigil. |
| 5 | The characters learn that a terrifying war machine is being transported through Sigil for use in conquering a Material Plane world. |
| 6 | A shop or tavern owner hires the characters to track down a deadbeat patron—a [solar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/solar.md), a [pit fiend](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md), a [death knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md), or other powerful being. |
| 7 | A group tries to kidnap a character, as the character is the key to a portal the group plans to use. |
| 8 | A villain looks remarkably like one of the characters, enough so that a [kolyarut](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/kolyarut-mpp.md) or [cuprilach rilmani](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/cuprilach-rilmani-mpp.md) (both detailed in "Morte's Planar Parade") mistakes the character for the scoundrel. |
| 9 | An [archmage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) new to the city offers to reward the characters with a magic item if they serve as their touts and sedan chair carriers for a day. |
| 10 | A [dabus](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/dabus-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") requests the characters' aid in removing someone or someplace from Sigil before the Lady of Pain learns of it. |
