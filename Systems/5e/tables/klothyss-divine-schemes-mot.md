| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Convinced that Heliod's boundless ambition will destroy Theros, Klothys creates an artifact that will destroy the sun god once he claims it as his own. She needs mortal heroes who can demonstrate the artifact's power by vanquishing Erebos's servants, and in the process stoke Heliod's envy. |
| 2 | Concerned by the spread of Meletian influence, Klothys fills the dreams of the polis's people with treachery. Neighbors attack neighbors, and attempts by Ephara's followers to intervene only redirect the violence toward the polis's patron. |
| 3 | Klothys becomes convinced that mortals giving worship to the gods distorts their proper relationship to each other, and she sets out to abolish religion. |
| 4 | Now that she has left the Underworld, Klothys knows it's only a matter of time until the titans escape. To prepare the world for the horrors of that inevitable conflict, she unleashes Underworld beasts into the mortal realm, trusting that the mayhem will bring forth heroes who can ultimately defeat the titans. |
