# Star-Spawn of Cthulhu
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 348*  

*This enormous and strange octopoid creature has clawed hands, a powerful but distended cranium, and winglike spines on its back.*

These masters of psychic communication and dimensional manipulation can transport themselves and others across enormous distances.

## Mastery of Life and Destruction

The star-spawn of Cthulhu harnessed mysterious energies of life and destruction to grow new life with remarkable speed (and some degree of wastage and cancerous tumors) and to turn living flesh into miasmic vapor through nothing more than focused attention.

## Rituals to Cthulhu

Their goals are simple: oppose the mi-go and aid dread Cthulhu. The starâ€‘spawn destroy creatures that will not serve as slaves and sacrifices, rather than allowing them to serve another master. Above all, they insist that all creatures venerate great Cthulhu and sacrifice life and treasure in his name. Their ultimate aim is to bend the heavens themselves and ensure that the stars are rightly positioned in their orbits to herald Cthulhu's inevitable return.

## Traits

***Psychic Absorption.*** Whenever the star spawn is subjected to psychic damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hp equal to the psychic damage dealt.

***Void Traveler.*** The star spawn of Cthulhu doesn't require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The star spawn of Cthulhu makes two Crushing Claws attacks and one Dimensional Stomp attack, or it makes three Void Bolt attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Disintegrating Gaze, if available.

***Crushing Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`2d12 + 7`) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (`3d8`) necrotic damage.

***Dimensional Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d20 + 7`) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (`3d8`) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or be teleported to an unoccupied space the star spawn can see within 30 feet of it.

***Void Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+15` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (`5d8 + 10`) necrotic damage.

***Disintegrating Gaze (Recharge 5-6).*** One creature the star spawn can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 27 (`6d8`) necrotic damage and be transformed into a misty cloud for 1 minute. The transformed creature's only method of movement is a flying speed of 10 feet, and it can enter and occupy the space of another creature. In addition, the transformed target can't talk, attack, cast spells, or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The transformed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 13 (`3d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or ending the effect on itself on a successful one. A creature killed by this effect can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell.

## Bonus Actions

***Interdimensional Step.*** The star spawn of Cthulhu teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Small tears in reality appear at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
