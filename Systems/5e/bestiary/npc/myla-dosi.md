***Pack Tactics.*** Myla has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of its allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Myla has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Alchemical Flame (Recharge 6).*** Myla unleashes fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
