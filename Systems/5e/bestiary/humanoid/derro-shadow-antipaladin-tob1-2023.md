# Derro Shadow Antipaladin
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 89*  

*This blue-skinned creature resembles a stunted dwarf. Its colorless eyes are large, and its white hair is wild. The expression on its face is a terrible rictus of madness and hate*.

All derro are mad, but some devote their very souls to the service of insanity. They embrace the powers of darkness and channel shadow through their minds to break the sanity of any creatures they encounter. Derro shadow antipaladins are the elite servants of gods like Nyarlathotep and the Black Goat of the Woods.

## Herald of Madness

The shadow antipaladin is insanity personified. Despite being called paladins, these unhinged creatures aren't swaggering warriors encased in steel or their dark reflections. A shadow antipaladin instead serves as a more subtle vector for the madness of its patron. They are masters of shadow magic and stealth who attack the faith of those who believe that goodness can survive the approaching, dark apotheosis. Death, madness, and darkness spread in the shadow antipaladin's wake.

## Traits

***Evasion.*** If the shadow antipaladin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the antipaladin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Insanity.*** The shadow antipaladin has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Magic Resistance.*** The shadow antipaladin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Necrotic Weapons.*** The shadow antipaladin's weapon attacks are magical. When the antipaladin hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `2d8` necrotic damage (included in the attack).

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the shadow antipaladin has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The derro makes two Scimitar or Heavy Crossbow attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage plus 9 (`2d8`) necrotic damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d10 + 4`) piercing damage plus 9 (`2d8`) necrotic damage.

***Infectious Insanity (Recharge 5-6).*** The shadow antipaladin magically assaults the minds of up to three creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 21 (`6d6`) psychic damage and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) for 1 minute as its mind fills with thoughts of eldritch terrors and otherworldly entities. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). An [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The shadow antipaladin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the antipaladin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
