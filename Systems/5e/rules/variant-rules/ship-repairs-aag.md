# Ship Repairs
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide p. 25* 

Nonmagical repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 hit point of damage to a berthed ship takes 1 day and costs 20 gp for materials and labor. Damage to shipboard weapons can be repaired just as quickly (1 hit point per day), but at half the cost (10 gp per hit point).

The [mending](/Systems/5e/spells/mending.md) spell is a cheaper, less time-consuming way to make repairs. Casting [mending](/Systems/5e/spells/mending.md) on a damaged ship or shipboard weapon restores a number of hit points to the target equal to `1d8` plus the spellcaster's spellcasting ability modifier. The target can regain hit points from that spell no more than once per hour.
