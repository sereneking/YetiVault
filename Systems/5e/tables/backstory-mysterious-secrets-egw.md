|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Years ago, my best friend came to me in the middle of the night and gave me a key that glowed with an icy blue light. I never saw that friend again. |
| 2 | I was the only witness to a cold-blooded murder. In the aftermath, I saw the killer take a gold coin with a ruby inlaid at its center from the victim's body. |
| 3 | I once had a dream where an old stranger looked me dead in the eye, screamed "Scourger!" at the top of their lungs, and then exploded into a column of flame. |
| 4 | While exploring near my home, I found a cliff with a bunch of caverns dug out of it, all of them large enough for people to hide within. |
| 5 | I once saw a cat that seemed to be moving with a strange sense of purpose. I followed it to the dwelling of an important local elder, where it gazed through the window for an hour. Then it suddenly shook itself and raced away, as though a spell had been broken. |
| 6 | One of my parents left home in the middle of a storm, in the middle of the night. They had their sword and shield. They came back a week later, with the shield practically in pieces. They never talked about that night. |
| 7 | I had a friend who was a farmer. Every week, their crops doubled in size until they had pumpkins as big as houses. Then the next week, the friend was gone and their fields were torched. I never heard from them again. |
| 8 | I once saw an enormous figure walking through the clouds on a stormy night. At one point, they looked at me, and then kept walking. |
| 9 | I woke up one night to find one of my siblings perched on my chest, staring into my eyes. They said, "The time is soon," and then giggled and ran off. When I asked them, they had no memory of the event. |
| 10 | I once saw a giant bird soar past overhead. It croaked out a cry that sounded like my name, then disappeared beyond the clouds. |
| 11 | I ate a fruit whose seeds spelled out a magic word where I'd cast them onto the ground. Years later, I saw the same word spelled out within a slice of bread. |
| 12 | A warrior friend of mine died. But every so often, I swear I see that friend in their old armor, at the corner of my vision. |
| 13 | An old seer once touched my forehead and gave me a vision of a flaming bird chained beneath a mountain, squirming and wailing in the darkness. |
| 14 | Once while on a boat, I heard a voice rumbling around me. I looked down below the water, and I swear I saw golden eyes looking up at me. |
| 15 | While I was eating, a whole potato exploded into worms, and I suffered a vision of a gigantic worm eating the world like a giant apple. |
| 16 | While picking flowers, I saw a tall figure with red skin and horns wandering the meadow. The flowers grew taller where they walked, but I fled in fear and never saw the figure again. |
| 17 | I was attacked by wolves in the woods one day, and was saved by a stranger with a bandage over their eyes. This person shone with silver light and was covered with scarsâ€”and I think I might have seen black wings tucked in at their back. |
| 18 | While trying to forge a sword, I accidentally burned myself with the red-hot blade. A strange vision then came to me, of powerful weapons calling out for me to wield them. |
| 19 | I once met someone fleeing through the woods who said they had escaped from some evil place. I asked what that meant, but the stranger fell dead on the spot. When I returned with help to collect the body, it was gone. |
| 20 | I once caught a falling star. It looked up from my hands and smiled, then told me to look for it on the day when fire erupts from the earth. |
