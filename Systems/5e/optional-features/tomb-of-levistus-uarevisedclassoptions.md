# Tomb of Levistus
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level

As a reaction when you take damage, you can entomb yourself in ice, which melts away at the end of your next turn. You gain 10 temporary hit points per warlock level, which take as much of the triggering damage as possible. You also gain vulnerability to fire damage, your speed is reduced to 0, and you are [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). These effects all end when the ice melts.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
