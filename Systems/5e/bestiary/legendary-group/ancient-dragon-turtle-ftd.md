# Ancient Dragon Turtle

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

As they are presented in the *Monster Manual*, dragon turtles don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, you can give an adult or ancient dragon turtle access to lair actions, increasing its challenge rating by 1. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon turtle can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon turtle can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Blasting Current.** A strong water current moves through the dragon turtle's lair. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon turtle must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be moved 30 feet in a direction of the dragon turtle's choice. On a success, the creature is moved 10 feet instead.  
- **Entangling Kelp.** Strands of spectral kelp reach out to ensnare creatures in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the lair that the dragon turtle can see. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the end of its next turn.  
- **Steam Eruption.** Steam erupts in a 15-foot cone from a point on the ground the dragon turtle can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Being underwater doesn't grant creatures resistance to this damage.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region containing a dragon turtle's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Diverting Currents.** Underwater currents push unwanted visitors away from the lair. While swimming in these currents, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), even if a creature has a swimming speed.  
- **Elemental Portals.** Crevasses on the ocean floor within 1 mile of the dragon turtle's lair form two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing creatures of elemental water into the world to dwell nearby.  
- **Hot Water.** Geothermal vents heat the water within 6 miles of the dragon turtle's lair to 100 degrees Fahrenheit.  

If the dragon turtle dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
