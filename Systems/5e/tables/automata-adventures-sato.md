`dice: [](automata-adventures-sato.md#^automata-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Fleeing interplanar bounty hunters, a three-horned tiefling named Romerillo (chaotic good, tiefling [spy](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) seeks refuge on one of the Upper Planes. Romerillo asks the characters to sneak them aboard the Concordant Express. |
| 2 | Disguised as Serafil, a [shator demodand](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/shator-demodand-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") assumes the council member's position and has the "impostor" arrested. Serafil's disheveled secretary beseeches the characters for aid. |
| 3 | A chaotic evil [quadrone](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md) tampers with the street numbers at night, causing widespread gridlock as modrons leave for work each morning. The Council of Order asks the characters to investigate. |
| 4 | A [marid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) fruit vendor is arrested in the Inverse for color-coordinating the produce in their stall. The genie petitions the characters to defend them in the nonsensical courts of the Hall of Discord. |
