# Sunburst
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*8th-level, Evocation*

- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, fire and a piece of sunstone
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` radiant damage and is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
