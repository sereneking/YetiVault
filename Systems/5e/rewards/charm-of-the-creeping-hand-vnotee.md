# Charm of the Creeping Hand

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an unarmed strike, you can infuse your strike with life-stealing energy. Your attack then deals an extra `1d10` necrotic damage, and you gain 5 "temporary hit points". Once used five times, the charm vanishes.
