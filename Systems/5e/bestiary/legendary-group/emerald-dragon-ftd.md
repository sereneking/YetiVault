# Emerald Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Beguiling Whisper.** The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.  
- **Distort Perceptions.** The dragon attempts to alter the perceptions of one creature it can see within its lair. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage and have disadvantage on saving throws until the start of its next turn.  
- **Vanish.** The dragon becomes [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region surrounding a legendary emerald dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Crystal Profusion.** Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and veins of emerald gemstones.  
- **Fiery Sight.** Fire and lava within 6 miles of the lair become conduits for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any area of fire or lava in that region.  
- **Subtle Obstruction.** Rocks within 6 miles of the dragon's lair sometimes move of their own accord, usually when no one is watching. Often the rocks obstruct the approach to the emerald dragon's lair, with boulders moving to block narrow defiles, way-markers tumbling off the path, or smaller stones shifting beneath travelers' feet to send them tumbling down slopes or into rivers.  
- **Thriving Wildlife.** [Giant lizards](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-lizard.md) are attracted to the area within 6 miles of the lair and settle there in large numbers.  

If the dragon dies, the population of giant lizards near the lair returns to normal levels over the course of `1d10` days. Rocks immediately stop moving of their own accord. The existing abundance of crystals and emeralds remains, but new ones form at a normal rate.
