# Mind Flayer Nothic
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 155*  

A nothic is a monstrous creature with terrible talons and a single great eye. When driven to violence, it uses its horrific gaze to rot the flesh from its enemies' bones.

## Traits

***Keen Sight.*** The nothic has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The nothic makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The nothic magically emits psychic energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence saving throw or take 10 (`2d8 + 1`) psychic damage and have the [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition until the end of its next turn.

***Weird Insight.*** The nothic targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must contest its Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check against the nothic's Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If the nothic wins, it magically learns one fact or secret about the target. The target automatically wins if it is immune to being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed).
