The Crusader's Shortsword is a sentient lawful good [+1 shortsword](/Systems/5e/items/1-weapon.md) (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.

The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties:

- The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished.  
- A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute.  
- While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the [crusader's mantle](/Systems/5e/spells/crusaders-mantle.md) spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn.
