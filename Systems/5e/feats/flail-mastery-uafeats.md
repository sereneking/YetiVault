# Flail Mastery
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 3*  

The [flail](/Systems/5e/items/flail.md) is a tricky weapon to use, but you have spent countless hours mastering it. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with a flail.  
- As a bonus action on your turn, you can prepare yourself to extend your flail to sweep over targets' [shields](/Systems/5e/items/shield.md). Until the end of this turn, your attack rolls with a flail gain a +2 bonus against any target using a [shield](/Systems/5e/items/shield.md).  
- When you hit with an opportunity attack using a flail, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
