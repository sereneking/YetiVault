| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An abandoned [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) is being raised by a family of [faerie dragons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-violet.md), who eagerly encourage the wyrmling's mischievous habits. |
| 2 | A [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) searches for whoever made the dragon's friendâ€”a suit of [animated armor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md) able to make witty, if limited, conversation. |
| 3 | A [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) has convinced a lost [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) that the latter is also a moonstone dragon, cursed by an archfey of winter. The two travel together, causing trouble in the name of lifting the "curse." |
| 4 | [Ettercaps](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/ettercap.md) captured a [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md), who has so far avoided becoming dinner by teaching the ettercaps to create wild, impossible sculptures with their webs. |
| 5 | A [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) torments a group of lost modrons by tricking them into performing chaotic acts. |
| 6 | A [moonstone dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/moonstone-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) has volunteered to be a spy in a conflict between a group of [pixies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/pixie.md) and a group of [quicklings](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/quickling-mpmm.md). Both sides believe the wyrmling is working exclusively for them. |
