# +1 Dragonhide Belt
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a monk)*  


This finely detailed belt is made of dragonhide. While wearing it, you gain a +1 bonus to the saving throw DCs of your ki features. In addition, you can use an action to regain ki points equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die. You can't use this action again until the next dawn.
