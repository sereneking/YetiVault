# Rune Carver Apprentice
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 8*  

You've begun studying the art of runecraft.

You learn the comprehend languages spell. You can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using any spell slots you have.

You know two runes of your choice from the Rune Spells table. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can mark one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you touch with a rune you know. You temporarily learn one 1st-level spell based on the rune you inscribed, as specified in the Rune Spells table, and you know the spell until you finish a long rest, when the rune fades.
