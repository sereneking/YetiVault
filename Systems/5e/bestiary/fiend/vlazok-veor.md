# Vlazok
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 238*  

Skeletal, quadrupedal horrors, vlazoks are particularly suited to battlefield cleanup in the Outer Planes. They love to stomp across battlefields after the fiercest fighting is over, trampling survivors and crushing pockets of resistance. When vlazoks anticipate an influx of enemies, these demons jump on them from above to crush them.

Vlazoks have keen senses, owing to the eyes positioned all around their hideous heads. They easily lose interest in their tasks unless powerful commanders, such as demon lords, keep them in line. Without careful direction, vlazoks become unhinged agents of chaos, smashing through crowds of weaker demons and decimating their ranks with powerful attacks.
