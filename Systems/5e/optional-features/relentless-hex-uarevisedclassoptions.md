# Relentless Hex
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level

Your curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the target cursed by your [hex](/Systems/5e/spells/hex.md) spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblade's Curse and Sign of Ill Omen. To teleport in this way, you must be able to see the cursed target.
