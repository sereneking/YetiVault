## Traits

***Chameleon Skin.*** Skriss has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.

***Stench.*** Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of Skriss must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Skriss has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Skriss can innately cast can cast the [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md) spell once per day, but the intended destination must be within 30 feet of another society member. This teleport effect can be disrupted (see "Faerzress"), which is how society members sometimes end up in far corners of the Underdark, separated from their fellows.

**1/day each**: [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md)
