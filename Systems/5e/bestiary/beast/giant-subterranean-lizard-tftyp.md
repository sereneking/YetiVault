## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lizard makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. One attack can be replaced by Swallow.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) piercing damage and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the lizard can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Swallow.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller creature the lizard is grappling. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) piercing damage. The target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lizard, and it takes 10 (`3d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the lizard's turns. The lizard can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the lizard dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
