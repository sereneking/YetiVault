# Trollkin Reaver
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 371*  

*The humanoid's skin is thick and knobby, and it sports wicked talons and tusks.*

In the north, the masses huddle in fear at night, dreading the horns and howls of reavers come to slaughter and pillage.

## Fearsome Savages

Trollkin have a well-deserved reputation for savagery, and the reavers help reinforce that perception among their neighbors. With claws and fangs larger and sharper than their brethren, reavers are a sight to behold.

## War Leaders

Raiding is a staple industry among the trollkin, and the reavers lead the most savage raiding parties in search of wealth, slaves, and supplies. They often recruit other creatures or mercenaries into their bands. It is not uncommon to see bloodthirsty humans, gnolls, or hobgoblins in a reaver's band.

## Spirit Talkers

Trollkin reavers are quite fearful of spirits and ghosts, and they listen to their clan shaman and to the words of powerful fey or giants. They prefer to raid only in times of good omens.

## Traits

***Regeneration.*** The trollkin reaver regains 5 hp at the start of its turn. If the trollkin takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the trollkin's next turn. The trollkin dies if it starts its turn with 0 hp and doesn't regenerate.

***Thick Hide.*** The trollkin reaver's skin is thick and tough, granting it a +1 bonus to Armor Class. This bonus is already factored into the trollkin's AC.

## Actions
