*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 162* 

| District | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Clifftop | This district caters to adventurers, with a wide array of businesses aimed at explorers and fortune hunters. It is the home base of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. | Upper Dura |
| Daggerwatch | Daggerwatch holds garrisons for both the Sharn Watch and the Brelish army, along with business and residences for those who support the garrisons. | Upper Dura |
| Highhold | A district built by dwarves for dwarves, Highhold has strong Mror influences in its architecture. It's a good place to find Mror goods and is home to talented smiths and brewers. | Upper Dura |
| Highwater | The finest residential district in Dura and the seat of House Vadalis, Highwater is largely comfortable in quality with a few wealthy estates. | Upper Dura |
| Hope's Peak | A relatively new temple district, with shrines and churches that have relocated from Fallen in Lower Dura. Hope's Peak includes several monasteries and a sacred grove. | Upper Dura |
| Overlook | Overlook is noteworthy for its kalashtar community, which maintains a community center, a shrine devoted to the Path of Light, and a few restaurants serving Sarlonan cuisine. | Upper Dura |
| The Bazaar | The largest commercial district in Sharn, an excellent place to buy or sell used—and possibly stolen—goods. | Middle Dura |
| Broken Arch | Once a proud residential district, Broken Arch has fallen into disrepair. Its housing is poor to modest in quality, though the shells of wealthy manors can still be seen. | Middle Dura |
| Hareth's Folly | A jumble of architectural styles, Hareth's Folly is a place to gamble and enjoy modest food and drink. The Hollow Tower is a center for aerial sports, and Hareth's Folly is where the Race of Eight Winds begins and ends. | Middle Dura |
| Rattlestone | Rattlestone is a tenement district. Its people have little but their pride, but there's a strong camaraderie between them. | Middle Dura |
| Stormhold | A comfortable residential district, Stormhold is home to the few powerful families that have remained in Dura. It's in better condition than most of Middle Dura, and Deneith mercenaries protect the streets. | Middle Dura |
| Tumbledown | A poor residential district, Tumbledown has experienced recent incursions from Daask. | Middle Dura |
| Underlook | The center of Sharn's nightlife before Menthis Plateau was built, Underlook is a collection of poor taverns and inns. | Middle Dura |
| Callestan | Home to an assortment of squalid and poor businesses, Callestan is a nexus for criminal activity and known as a stronghold of the Boromar Clan. | Lower Dura |
| Fallen | Sharn's oldest temple district, Fallen was abandoned after a floating tower crashed into the district during the Last War. Now it's a collection of wretched ruins. | Lower Dura |
| Gate of Gold | A squalid slum, providing miserable housing for desperate people. | Lower Dura |
| Malleon's Gate | A poor district originally inhabited by goblins, Malleon's Gate has become a haven for monstrous immigrants from Droaam and Darguun, along with members of Daask. | Lower Dura |
| Oldkeep | Another poor slum, largely home to dockworkers from Precarious. | Lower Dura |
| Precarious | The skydocks of Precarious pass goods between the towers and the port on the Dagger River below. The district is filled with warehouses, along with a handful of poor taverns. A small community of Sarlonans lives here. | Lower Dura |
| The Stores | A warehouse district with a large halfling population, with ties to the Boromar Clan. | Lower Dura |
