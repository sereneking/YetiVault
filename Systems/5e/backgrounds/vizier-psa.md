# Vizier
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 10*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History), [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of artisan's tools, one type of musical instrument  
- **Equipment.** A set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a scroll of your god's teachings, a vizier's cartouche, a set of [fine clothes](/Systems/5e/items/fine-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 25 gp  

You are a vizier, a servant of your god. You perform tasks that are essential to facilitating the initiates' journey, so the gods reward you with entry into the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh's blessing. You hope to achieve the most honored status in the afterlife by being the best possible servant to your god.

As a vizier, you can have any class, but you are especially likely to be a [cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md), a [druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md) (particularly if you serve Rhonas), or a [paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md).

## Feature: Voice of Authority

Your voice is the voice of your god, at least in theory. Your job might include training and instructing initiates, and they are required to obey you. In any circumstance, an initiate is expected to defer to your voice and obey your commands. If you abuse this authority, though, your god might personally punish you.

## Suggested Characteristics

A vizier's characteristics strongly reflect the ideals and personality of the god they serve.
