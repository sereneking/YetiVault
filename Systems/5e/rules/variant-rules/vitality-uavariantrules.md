# Vitality
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules p. 1* 

Some DMs find hit points bothersome. A fighter can survive a [fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md), a troll's rending claws, and a one-hundred-foot fall, only to crumple in a heap due to a kobold's dagger slash. This optional rule more realistically reflects the wear and tear a character suffers from wounds.

Each character has a pool of vitality in addition to hit points. A character's maximum vitality equals the character's Constitution score. Whenever a character takes 10 or more damage from an attack or effect, the character loses vitality. Divide the damage by 10 and round down. The result is how much vitality a character loses. In other words, a character loses 1 vitality for every 10 points of damage dealt by an attack or effect.

If a character suffers a critical hit, double the vitality lost, so that the character loses 2 vitality for every 10 points of damage. If a critical hit deals less than 10 damage, it still reduces vitality by 1.

Losing vitality causes a character's hit point maximum to drop. Calculate the character's current maximum using vitality instead of Constitution. Thus, as vitality drops, a character's Constitution modifier for determining hit points also drops.

A character reduced to 0 vitality is immediately reduced to 0 hit points. If a character is reduced to 0 hit points but his or her vitality remains above 0, any additional damage is applied instead to the character's vitality. A character is not [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) until both hit points and vitality reach 0.

Completing a long rest increases a character's vitality by 1 + the character's Constitution modifier, up to the character's maximum vitality. Effects that restore hit points have no effect on vitality. However, a character with maximum hit points who receives healing instead restores 1 vitality for every 10 points of healing.
