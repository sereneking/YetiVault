# Flame Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Blinding Smoke.** A cloud of smoke swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners, and the area is lightly obscured. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Curtain of Fire.** A wall of fire rises up from the ground within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, can take any shape the dragon wants, and is opaque. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (`6d6`) fire damage. Each creature that enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 21 (`6d6`) fire damage. The wall is extinguished when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  
- **Volcanic Debris.** The ground erupts with volcanic force at a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the point must make succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone and buried under rock and debris. The buried creature is restrained and can't breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a legendary flame dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Extreme Heat.** Temperatures rise within 6 miles of the lair, causing most water sources to dry up and all but the hardiest plants to wither.  
- **Fiery Tempers.** Arguments and misunderstandings erupt easily within 6 miles of the lair. Friendships are easily broken and criminal acts are common.  
- **Superheated Fumaroles.** Sulfur geysers dot the landscape within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, making the area inhospitable for most plants and creatures.  

If the dragon dies, Fiery Tempers disappears immediately, and temperatures return to normal within `1d10` days. Any geysers remain where they are.
