# Talarith
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a reigar who created it)*  


The [reigar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/reigar-bam.md) who creates this piece of jewelry chooses its form: bracelet, brooch, diadem, or necklace. While the reigar wears the talarith, any weapon wielded by the [reigar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/reigar-bam.md) deals an extra `1d6` force damage when it hits.

As an action, a reigar can use its talarith to summon a golem that looks just like the reigar. The golem obeys the reigar's commands and uses the [reigar's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/reigar-bam.md) statistics, except it is a Construct that doesn't have a talarith of its own. The golem vanishes after 1 hour, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. After summoning a golem, the reigar must finish a short or long rest before this property can be used again.
