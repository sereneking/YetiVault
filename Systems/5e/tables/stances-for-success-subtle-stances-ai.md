**Subtle Stances**

`dice: [](stances-for-success-subtle-stances-ai.md#^subtle-stances)`

| dice: d8 | Stance |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Incontinent Elder—Standing straight, knees together (excellent for surviving those long queues) |
| 2 | Addled Adder—Lying flat on the ground (perfect when attempting to hide) |
| 3 | Ponderous Pudding—Collapsed in a heap (useful when trying to disguise yourself as a drunken fool) |
| 4 | Frightened Gnome—Curled in the fetal position (excellent when about to take a lot of damage) |
| 5 | Ambitious Student—Standing with one armed raised (useful when trying to be seen) |
| 6 | Boisterous Brewmaster—Hand raised as if making a toast (excellent at preventing being slapped) |
| 7 | Hardy Harpy—Arms flapping wildly while singing (inspires people to leave you alone, and good for cooling off on hot days) |
| 8 | Broken Bridge—Face down on the ground with knees bent and posterior up (reduces visibility to foes in front, and makes a useful ramp for allies to jump off) |
