# Demogorgon

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Demogorgon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects: Demogorgon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Demogorgon creates an illusory duplicate of himself, which appears in his own space and lasts until initiative count 20 of the next round. On his turn, Demogorgon can move the illusory duplicate a distance equal to his walking speed (no action required). The first time a creature or object interacts physically with Demogorgon (for example, hitting him with an attack), there is a 50% chance chance that it is the illusory duplicate that is being affected, not Demogorgon himself, in which case the illusion disappears.  
- Demogorgon casts the [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md) spell four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Demogorgon doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing Demogorgon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- The area within 6 miles of the lair becomes overpopulated with lizards, poisonous snakes, and other venomous beasts.  
- Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become violent and crazed-even creatures that are normally docile.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Demogorgon table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Demogorgon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

### Madness of Demogorgon

If a creature goes mad in Demogorgon's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Demogorgon table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.
