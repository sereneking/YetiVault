%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*6th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (100-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a fistful of iron filings

You manifest a ravine of gravitational energy in a line originating from you that is 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `8d8` force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Each creature within 10 feet of the line but not in it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `8d8` force damage and be pulled toward the line until the creature is in its area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes**: [Wizard (Chronurgy Magic)](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard-chronurgy-magic-egw.md), [Wizard (Graviturgy Magic)](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard-graviturgy-magic-egw.md)
