# Maddening Hex
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level

As a bonus action, you cause a psychic disturbance around the target cursed by your [hex](/Systems/5e/spells/hex.md) spell or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblade's Curse and Sign of Ill Omen. When you do so, you deal psychic damage to the target and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The psychic damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage).
