# Dragon Fear
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 2*  

**Prerequisite**: [Dragonborn](/Systems/5e/races/dragonborn.md)

When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:

- Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can roar and expend a use of your breath weapon to force each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. If the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
