# Knight of Solamnia
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 30*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)  
- **Languages.** Two of your choice  
- **Equipment.** An insignia of rank, a [deck of cards](/Systems/5e/items/playing-card-set.md), a set of [common clothes](/Systems/5e/items/common-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You have trained to be a valorous warrior known as a Knight of Solamnia. Strict rules guide your every action, and you work to uphold them as you strive to defend the weak and oppose evil. Your honor is as important to you as your life.

## Feature: Squire of Solamnia

You gain the [Squire of Solamnia](/Systems/5e/feats/squire-of-solamnia-dsotdq.md) feat.

In addition, the Knights of Solamnia provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their fortresses or encampments.

## Building a Knight of Solamnia Character

Any class that has martial prowess can be a good fit in the Knights of Solamnia. [Fighters](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter.md) and [paladins](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md) make up the bulk of the knighthood's forces. [Clerics](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md) (often with the [War](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric-war-domain.md) domain) can also be found among the knights' ranks.

For a more unusual take on a Knight of Solamnia character, consider playing a bard of the [College of Valor](/Systems/5e/classes/bard-college-of-valor.md) (or the [College of Swords](/Systems/5e/classes/bard-college-of-swords-xge.md) from "Xanathar's Guide to Everything") or a [barbarian](/Systems/5e/classes/barbarian.md) devoted to the ideals of the nature god Habbakuk (perhaps adopting the [Path of the Zealot](/Systems/5e/classes/barbarian-path-of-the-zealot-xge.md) from "Xanathar's Guide to Everything").

### Knight of Solamnia Trinkets

When you make your character, roll once on the Knight of Solamnia Trinkets table instead of on the [Trinkets table](/Systems/5e/items/trinket.md) in the Player's Handbook for your starting trinket.
