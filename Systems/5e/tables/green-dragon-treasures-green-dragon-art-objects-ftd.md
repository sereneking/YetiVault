| dice: d10 | Object |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The polished skull of a unicorn, latticed with luminescent blooms |
| 2 | An elaborate necklace of yuan-ti origin, set with gleaming gems and dripping with strands of pearls |
| 3 | A harp, its pillar carved to resemble a beautiful elf who weeps loudly and inconsolably |
| 4 | A marble statue that once showed a knight vanquishing a dragon, but due to strategic damage, now looks like a knight tumbling into massive jaws |
| 5 | The baby teeth of a Humanoid, preserved in amber furred with a golden fungus that smells like gingerbread |
| 6 | A giant-sized hunting horn scrimshawed with elaborate patterns, the pewter only slightly tarnished |
| 7 | A stained glass window still set within a fragment of wall depicting the many deaths of an elf monarch |
| 8 | A triptych of silver mirrors, set in an ornate brambled iron frame sculpted to depict figures in a grotesque bacchanal |
| 9 | Quartz terrariums carried on the backs of tourmaline jaguars, overgrown with misshapen cacti |
| 10 | A string of skulls riddled with too many eye sockets, their jaws replaced by carved gemstones |
