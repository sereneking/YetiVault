# Downtime and Franchise Activity: Headquarters Modification
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 39* 

Major headquarters modifications are made as a regular part of franchise advancement (see ""Franchise Advancement"" earlier in this chapter). But it's sometimes desirable to update a previous modification in ways that don't provide any additional mechanical benefits.

Characters and franchise staff members can use this activity to modify an existing headquarters feature. This change is subject to DM approval, and is typically done within the same feature category, such as swapping one weapon option for another. In response to pressing need, the DM might allow a franchise to swap options between categories, such as losing a weapon option in favor of an arcane option. The DM can limit how often this activity is used.

## Resources

Once a modification is approved, this activity requires the involvement of the franchise's majordomo and at least one other character or staff member. This team must dedicate at least three workweeks to this activity, and the franchise must spend 1,000 gp per franchise rank to cover expenses. The DM might also require a side trek to gather necessary materials or hire specialist labor before the activity can be commenced.

## Resolution

One character or the majordomo acts as the lead for this activity, making an Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)) check to draft the modifications. A character or the majordomo must then make two ability checks to complete the modifications, using either Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or an Intelligence check using appropriate tools. With DM approval, a different ability and skill appropriate for the modification can be substituted for any of the checks.

Each check receives a +1 bonus for every two staff participating who are skilled hirelings, and a +1 bonus if any participant has the cartographer, loremonger, or hoardsperson position. The number of successes is compared to the Headquarters Modification table.

**Headquarters Modification**

| Successes | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | The modification fails, and the franchise incurs cost overruns of 1,000 gp per franchise rank. |
| 1 | The modification fails, and the franchise incurs cost overruns of 500 gp per franchise rank. However, the cause of the failure is apparent, granting advantage on any future checks to perform the same modification. |
| 2 | The modification succeeds but incurs a cost overrun of 100 gp per franchise rank. The modification also has a minor drawback, as determined by the DM. |
| 3 | The modification succeeds with no cost overruns or drawbacks. |

## Complications

A result of 0 successes or 1 success automatically creates a complication. Other results might create a complication at the DM's determination. The DM can select a complication or roll on the Headquarters Modification Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | An accident during the modification injures a franchise staff member. That NPC's family demands compensation equal to 100 gp per franchise rank. It might be possible to instead appease the family by performing a service. |
| 2 | A spy makes a copy of the plans for the modification, learning its function and taking that information back to a rival organization.* |
| 3 | The modification was based on information originating with a rival. If the modification failed, the plans were intentionally faulty. If it succeeded, the characters detected the fault, but must decide how to respond to the attempted sabotage.* |
| 4 | A local official insists that permits were needed for the modification, and demands payment or a favor to make the problem go away.* |
| 5 | The work causes the franchise headquarters to develop a quirk, such as strange noises, unwelcome smells, weird vibrations while mobile, and the like. Resolving the problem might require consulting a sage or an expert in headquarters construction. |
| 6 | The modification work uncovers a previously unknown problem with the headquarters, such as a structural defect, a dormant monster, bodies interred in the foundations, a concealed cursed item, and so forth. |
