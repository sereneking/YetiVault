# Relentless Slasher
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 242*  

A relentless slasher conducts its bloody work in silence then vanishes into shadow and infamy. Fixated on a specific individual or type of victim, it pursues its target with single-minded obsession.

Relentless killers are hateful, revenge-obsessed creatures that enter into pacts with fiends or other nefarious entities. Their bargains transform them into vicious butchers that exist only to indulge their endless bloodlust. While some who become relentless killers began life as innocents, any semblance of who they were is washed away in a tide of gore and rage. These killers' grisly work swiftly becomes the stuff of legends, striking fear into innocents across lands and over ages.

## Creating a Relentless Killer

Relentless killers come into being and undertake their terrifying sprees for a spectrum of reasons. When creating a relentless killer, consider what circumstances led to their transformation and signature methods. Roll or choose options from the Relentless Origins and Relentless Methods tables when creating your own, unique monstrous slayers.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If the slasher fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Shrouded Presence.*** The slasher is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, and it can't be detected by abilities that sense Fiends.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The slasher makes two Slasher's Knife attacks.

***Slasher's Knife.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) slashing damage plus 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it suffers a lingering wound that causes it to take 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns. Each time the slasher hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 3 (`1d6`). The wound ends if the target regains hit points or if a creature uses an action to stanch the wound, which requires a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check.

## Legendary Actions

***Slice.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Vanishing Strike (Costs 3 Actions).*** The slasher makes one Slasher's Knife attack. After the attack hits or misses, the slasher can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
