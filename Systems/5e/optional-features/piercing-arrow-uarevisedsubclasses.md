# Piercing Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses p. 4*  

You use transmutation magic to transform your arrow into an ethereal dart that passes through its targets. You use transmutation magic to give your arrow an ethereal quality. When you use this option, you don't make an attack roll for the attack. Instead, the arrow fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow, plus an extra `1d6` piercing damage. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage.

The piercing damage increases to `2d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
