*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a deck of cards
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You spray spectral cards from your hands or sleeve; the cards blind or slash at your enemies, and then vanish. Choose one of the following effects for the cards.

## Blinding Cards

Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of their next turn.

## Cutting Cards

Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage of cutting cards increases by `1d10` for every two slot levels above 2nd.
