# Adept of the Red Robes
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

Your pursuit of truth and dedication to maintaining the balance between all things has been recognized by the Order of the Red Robes, granting you these benefits:

- **Insightful Magic.** You learn one 2nd-level spell of your choice. The 2nd-level spell must be from the divination or transmutation school of magic. You can cast this feat's 2nd-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast this spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell's spellcasting ability is the one chosen when you gained the [Initiate of High Sorcery](/Systems/5e/feats/initiate-of-high-sorcery-ua2022heroesofkrynn.md) feat.  
- **Magical Balance.** When you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, and roll a 9 or lower on the `d20`, you can use your reaction to balance fate and treat the roll as a 10. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
