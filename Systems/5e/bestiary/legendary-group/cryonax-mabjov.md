# Cryonax

## Lair actions
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

When Cryonax occupies Frostfell, or any area that he has corrupted by inhabiting it for at least a week, he can command the snow and ice around him to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Cryonax can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Cryonax can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Ice and snow explode in radius of 60 feet around Cryonax. This creates a freezing mist full of hail and larger chunks of ice that will heavily obscure the area and last until initiative count 20 of the next round. All creatures within the area of effect take 13 (`3d8`) cold damage and must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- The air freezes in a 120 feet wide (and tall) hemisphere centered around Cryonax. This effect forms hundreds of sharp icicles. These immediately crash to the ground causing 14 (`4d6`) slashing damage to everyone in the area of effect (the damage is halved if a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw is successful). Afterwards the terrain becomes difficult and anyone falling [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) within it takes the damage again (no saving throw).  
- The frozen ground buckles, driving massive chunks of rock and ice into the air. `1d8` thirty-foot-tall stalagmites will rise into the air and all creatures in a 30-foot radius around Cryonax must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  

## Regional effects
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

The region containing Cryonax's lair is warped by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Within ten miles of the lair all water has frozen and any precipitation becomes thick snow and hail instead.  
- The ground beneath the lair is freezing, causing the earth to buckle and rise. Tremors become common within 5 miles of the lair. After five days any wooden structure or weaker has collapsed; within 10 days stone buildings are destroyed. For every hour in the area there is a 1 in 10 chance that a tremor strikes forcing everyone other than Cryonax to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) and suffer 9 (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage.  
- Within 1 mile of Cryonax's location inside the lair the air becomes bitterly cold and difficult to breath. Each hour while within this area every living creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer a level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).  

If Cryonax is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next `1d10` weeks.
