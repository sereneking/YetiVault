|------------|------|
| 1 | Did you speak? I thought 'twas the braying of an ass. |
| 2 | Not even otyughs would dine on this. |
| 3 | Am I to make pie from these crumbs? |
| 4 | Are you the lord here? I bring dark tidings from afar. |
| 5 | You would make a mistress of the moon, if it shone on you. |
| 6 | You have lit my lantern wick, that's for sure! I am aflame. |
| 7 | You! Fetch my steed! |
| 8 | 'Tis said that in Veluna they eat such things. |
| 9 | Careful, whelp. Far greater than thou hath perished for less. |
| 10 | Hold on to thy seat. This trail has more bumps to come! |
| 11 | I feel I have inherited much from this meeting. |
| 12 | Stop saying that! Are you a fool? |
| 13 | From this wound I shall not recover. You have slain me. |
| 14 | Let us dance in the whistling wind! |
| 15 | You dare speak of this, rascal? |
| 16 | On the contrary, I acknowledge all your faults. |
| 17 | My liege, he's dead. |
| 18 | It seems we are in a bit of a pickle. |
| 19 | No, master! He turned to stone. |
| 20 | But I am your son! |
| 21 | Murder! Oh, murder! |
| 22 | Hurts, doesn't it? |
| 23 | This portends an unpleasant day. |
| 24 | What manner of ghoul is this I see before me? |
| 25 | Knaves, footpads, and liars. I am in good company! |
| 26 | Even a beholder wouldn't have seen that one coming! |
| 27 | This truly is the worst outcome. |
| 28 | Tomorrow, at sunrise, I shall no longer be here. |
| 29 | Hurry! 'Tis best I die quickly. |
| 30 | Lend me your hand. There is something I must show you. |
| 31 | I would not wish you upon a toad. |
| 32 | You beastly little imp! |
| 33 | Oh, let us make merry again soon! |
| 34 | Night comes, and we must away! |
| 35 | I smell a foul wind. |
| 36 | Tomorrow should dawn merrier. |
| 37 | My hope is shriveled like a grape. Let us make wine of it! |
| 38 | Tell me what I must do. |
| 39 | Speak only good news! My mood is leaden. |
| 40 | I think I'll hide in the chimney. |
| 41 | Enough! I shall not be kicked by any mule! |
| 42 | An unnecessary footnote, you are. |
| 43 | I would tear the world in two for a quaff. |
| 44 | How now, friend. Why the long face? |
| 45 | I shall make a banquet of your dreams. |
| 46 | Hush, my sweet dumpling. |
| 47 | We danced too long; now all the music is gone. |
| 48 | Such humor. I can barely hold my sides. |
| 49 | Who goes there, on this woebegone, rain-lashed night? |
| 50 | The words catch in my throat. I cannot speak them! |
| 51 | That is a goatish look you have upon your face. |
| 52 | Is that a hoot or a growl? It chills my blood! |
| 53 | A tailor could not sew a finer lie. |
| 54 | Silence, piglet! You have squealed enough. |
| 55 | This dream shall soon end. |
| 56 | As for this one: let your sword speak. |
| 57 | A runt has no place among giants. |
| 58 | Perhaps I shall have that drink, after all. |
| 59 | Awake! The time is upon us. |
| 60 | Strange bedfellows, these ones. |
| 61 | I have a wicked thought, if you will hear it. |
| 62 | Well, here is a serpent! |
| 63 | Two truths told. A lie is sure to follow. |
| 64 | I warn you: my patience has sunk. |
| 65 | It seems I am betrayed. |
| 66 | Have you met my husband? |
| 67 | Bar the door! They're here! |
| 68 | Let me answer this one. |
| 69 | I shall not rest 'til the deed is done. |
| 70 | My enemies are dead, yet I hunger still. |
| 71 | This is no night for joy. |
| 72 | See, 'twas I all along! |
| 73 | Here's some gristle to chew upon. |
| 74 | I feel like a giant stepped on my head. |
| 75 | All is lost! No prayer can save us now! |
| 76 | Oh, for a sword! |
| 77 | What malice are you planning? |
| 78 | What fresh horror is this? |
| 79 | Something stirs below. |
| 80 | See! I blush red as a radish. |
