|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Attempts to salvage a sunken merchant ship are being thwarted by a bronze dragon who claims "finder's rights." |
| 2 | Betrayed by corrupt city officials, a bronze dragon is punishing the city by preventing ships from entering its harbor, but the citizens are suffering. |
| 3 | A bronze dragon gathers crusaders to rescue a hero imprisoned in the Abyss—a mission that will mean almost certain death for the rank-and-file troops. |
| 4 | A bronze dragon has conscripted a local militia into an ongoing conflict with a black dragon who lives in the waterlogged ruins of a magical academy. |
| 5 | The bronze dragon who protects a coastal nation is stricken by a curse, and the cure lies in a sunken temple the dragon destroyed generations ago. |
| 6 | Believing that the winner of a city's democratic election is unworthy of the job, a bronze dragon is now supporting an authoritarian leader instead. |
| 7 | A bronze dragon has been approached by both sides in a war and needs agents to get close to both leaders to discover which has the worthier claim. |
| 8 | A bronze dragon fears that a remote library-fortress is no longer the best place to safeguard an infamous tome called the Antitheorem Codex—and has decided to prove it by attacking the site. |
