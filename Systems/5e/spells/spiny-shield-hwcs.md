# Spiny Shield
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 reaction
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a small quill
- **Duration:** 1 round

An ethereal barrier of spikes, made of magical force, interposes itself between you and an attacker. Until your next turn, when you are hit by a melee attack, the barrier reduces the damage you are dealt by `2d4`, and deals the same amount of piercing damage to the attacker. The shield is ineffective against ranged attackers, but still provides a +2 bonus to AC (treat as half cover) against them for the duration.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 1st level, increase the spell's effect by an additional `1d4` for every slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
