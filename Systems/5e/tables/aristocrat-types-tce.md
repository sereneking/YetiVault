**Aristocrat Types**

`dice: [](aristocrat-types-tce.md#^aristocrat-types)`

| dice: d6 | Aristocrats |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | **Local Lord**. Convinced that power and prestige lie just around the corner, this minor lordling grasps for every opportunity to climb the ranks. |
| 2 | **Merchant Mastermind**. Reputation, wealth, and power are one and the same for the head of a family with world-spanning business holdings. |
| 3 | **Nomadic Princeling**. Nothing is more appealing to this princeling than treasure. Their sprawling merchant caravan trails behind their palanquin as far as the eye can see. |
| 4 | **Double Dealer**. The leader of a noble family has turned against their nation, secretly opposing their liege for personal gain or ethical reasons. |
| 5 | **Ambitious Entrepreneur**. The sole heir of a vast fortune, this entrepreneur seeks allies to expand their wealth in a new business on the international, global, or planar stage. |
| 6 | **Future Ruler**. This young noble is destined to rule, but currently their whims are fickle and dangerous. |
