**Dragon Death Throes**

`dice: [](death-of-a-dragon-dragon-death-throes-ftd.md#^dragon-death-throes)`

| dice: d6 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The dragon immediately uses one of its lair actions, centering the effect on itself. For example, a fallen black dragon and any characters around it might be pulled into a nearby pool of water, and a copper dragon's body might be swallowed suddenly in mud. |
| 2 | The dragon uses its breath weapon one last time. |
| 3 | The dragon's body transforms into stone, metal, lava, ice, or mist. Or the body dissipates, leaving behind only a transformed heart or other organ. |
| 4 | Roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](/Systems/5e/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "[Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md)" section of the "Player's Handbook", rerolling any inappropriate result. |
| 5 | A surge of life energy erupts from the dragon, causing each creature within 120 feet of the body to gain the benefit of finishing a long rest. |
| 6 | The body is drawn through a portal to the lair of one of the dragon's echoes on another world, increasing that echo's power. |
