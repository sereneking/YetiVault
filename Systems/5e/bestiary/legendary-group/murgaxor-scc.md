# Murgaxor

## Lair actions
_Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Murgaxor can take one of the following lair actions; after he does so, he can't use that action again until he finishes a long rest:

- **Clay Behemoth.** A [clay golem](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md) erupts from the floor in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The golem obeys Murgaxor's commands, takes its turns on initiative count 10 (losing initiative ties), fights until destroyed, and reverts to a mound of inanimate clay after 1 hour.  
- **Earthen Fist.** A medium fist of packed earth rises from the floor in an unoccupied space that Murgaxor can see within 30 feet of him. The fist attacks when one creature of his choice is within 4 feet of the fist. The fist has a +11 bonus to hit, and on a hit, the target takes 13 (`3d8`) bludgeoning damage and is grappled (escape DC 15). The fist disappears if the attack roll misses or if the grapple ends. When the fist disappears, this lair action recharges, allowing Murgaxor to use it again.  
- **Necrotic Burst.** Tendrils of necrotic energy erupt from the ritual circle and lash out at any number of creatures Murgaxor can see within 15 feet of the circle. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or it takes 5 (`1d10`) necrotic damage and can't regain hit points until the start of its next turn.  
- **Summon Mephits.** Murgaxor summons four [mud mephits](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/mud-mephit.md) that appear in unoccupied spaces within 15 feet of the ritual circle. The mephits obey Murgaxor's commands, take their turns on initiative count 15 (losing initiative ties), and fight until destroyed.
