In the "Age of Arcanum", an archmage named Clemain Astural was the first to make contact with an otherworldly power of the Realms Beyond that called itself the Sightless. His legendary writings, the well-guarded "Astural Scrolls", say that the entity's words of greeting to him were:

"I am the Sightless. Will you not lend me your eyes?"

The "Astural Scrolls" are vague about the powers of the Sightless—also sometimes called the Sightless One, the Borrower of Eyes, and the Lurker Behind One Thousand Eyes—but they are specific about several things. First, Astural willingly relinquished his own sight to the Sightless in exchange for his patron's magical powers. He gained all the power he ever wanted, but Exandria was as alien to the Sightless as the Sightless was to Exandria. Forced to rely upon this entity's horrific interpretations of the world around it, Astural quickly lost his grip on reality.

In time, Astural's unchecked devastation was stopped by great heroes of the time, and his scrolls were confiscated. They exist in the "Westhall Academy in Westruun", and the second scroll, though secured in a deep vault, still holds the secrets of the ritual Astural used to contact the Sightless all those years ago.
