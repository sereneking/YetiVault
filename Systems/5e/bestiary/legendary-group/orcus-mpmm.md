# Orcus

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Orcus can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Deadly Utterance.** Orcus's voice booms throughout the lair. His utterance causes one creature of his choice to be subjected to [power word kill](/Systems/5e/spells/power-word-kill.md). Orcus needn't see the creature, but he must be aware that the individual is in the lair.  
- **Grasp of the Dead.** Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on the ground in a 20-foot square that he can see. They last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature in that area when the arms appear must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the arms disappear or until Orcus releases them (no action required).  
- **Undead Servants.** Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as [skeletons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md), [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), or [ghouls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md). These undead obey his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Orcus's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Charnel Realm.** The air is filled with the stench of rotting flesh, and buzzing flies grow thick within the region.  
- **Undead Beasts.** Dead Beasts periodically animate as Undead mockeries of their former selves. Skeletal and zombie versions of local wildlife are commonly seen in the area.  

If Orcus dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
