# Raven Queen's Blessing
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Raven Queen" Patron, [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md) cantrip

When you score a critical hit with your [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md) cantrip, pick yourself or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature can immediately expend a Hit Die to regain hit points equal to the roll + the creature's Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 hit point).
