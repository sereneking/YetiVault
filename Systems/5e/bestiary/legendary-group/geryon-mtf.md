# Geryon

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Geryon can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Geryon causes a blast of cold to burst from the ground at a point he can see within 120 feet of him. The cold fills a cube, 10 feet on each side, centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (`8d6`) cold damage.  
- Geryon targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) for 1 minute. The target can end the effect on itself if it deals any damage to one or more of its allies.  
- Geryon casts the [banishment](/Systems/5e/spells/banishment.md) spell.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Geryon's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see shimmering portals leading to places they consider safe. Passing through a portal always deposits a traveler somewhere in Stygia.  
- Freezing strong winds howl around the area within 1 mile of the lair.  
- Howls and screams fill the air within 1 mile of the lair. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or derive no benefit from the rest.  

If Geryon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
