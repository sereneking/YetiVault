# Wand of Silence
*Wand, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge to cast the [silence](/Systems/5e/spells/silence.md) spell (save DC 15). The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
