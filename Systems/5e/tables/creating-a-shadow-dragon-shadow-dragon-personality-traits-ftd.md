**Shadow Dragon Personality Traits**

`dice: [](creating-a-shadow-dragon-shadow-dragon-personality-traits-ftd.md#^shadow-dragon-personality-traits)`

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I am a creature of endless consumption, always looking for the next thing to possess or devour. |
| 2 | I am rarely satisfied with what I have. I envy others' lives and belongings. |
| 3 | I'm constantly calculating my next move. If I'm not at least one step ahead of foes, I'm a step behind. |
| 4 | I loathe my existence, and the only thing that pleases me is sharing my misery. |
| 5 | It isn't that I'm unsympathetic to others' needs; I just don't let sympathy get in the way. |
| 6 | Everything is a transaction. I don't do anything before I know what's in it for me. |
| 7 | It's nearly impossible for me to conceal my contempt for others. |
| 8 | I truly regret the things I have done and will do whatever I can to atone. |
