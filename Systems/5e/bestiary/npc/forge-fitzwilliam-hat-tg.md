# Forge Fitzwilliam
*Source: Honor Among Thieves: Thieves' Gallery*  

Forge Fitzwilliam is a con artist who manipulates others with lies and flattery. The audacious criminal has left a trail of broken promises and false identities along the Sword Coast. He conceals flexible morals and a ready dagger behind his winning smile.

Forge enjoys the finer things in life, particularly when they result from his own cleverness. Decades of heists and cons haven't slaked his thirstâ€”in fact, his ambitions only grow grander with time.

## Traits

***Disarming Charm.*** While Forge isn't wearing armor, his AC includes his Charisma modifier.

***Double-Cross.*** If Forge hits a creature friendly to him with an attack roll, the attack is automatically a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Forge is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if he fails, provided he isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Forge makes two Dagger attacks, two Heavy Crossbow attacks, or one of each.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus 24 (`7d6`) poison damage, and the target is [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of its next turn.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage plus 24 (`7d6`) poison damage. Hit or Miss: If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the start of Forge's next turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Cunning.*** Forge takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action, or he gives himself advantage on the next attack roll he makes before the end of this turn.

## Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** Forge halves the damage he takes from an attack that hits him. He must be able to see the attacker.
