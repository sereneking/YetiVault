## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While the gargoyle remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue.

***Faultless Tracker.*** The creature that caused the gargoyle to animate becomes its quarry. The gargoyle knows the direction and distance to its quarry as long the quarry remains within Drakkenheim or until the gargoyle is destroyed.

***Keen Sight.*** The gargoyle has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Magic Weapons.*** The gargoyle's weapon attacks are magical.

***Rejuvenation.*** If the wall gargoyle is destroyed, it regains all its hit points in 1 hour unless a [disintegrate](/Systems/5e/spells/disintegrate.md) spell is cast on its remains.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gargoyle makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) slashing damage.
