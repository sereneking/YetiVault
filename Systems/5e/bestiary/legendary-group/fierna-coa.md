# Fierna

## Regional effects
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

The region containing Fierna's lair is corrupted by her presence, which creates the following effect:

- **Smoke-cloud.** A vast fog rises 3 feet above ground within 1 mile of the lair, completely obscuring the ground. Any creature having the prone condition at the start of their turn must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`2d12`) necrotic damage from choking on the noxious fumes.  

If Fierna dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Fierna can take one lair action to cause the following effect or one from the archdevil lair action list (page 214); she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Fiery Reversal.** Fierna exchanges places with a creature she can see within 30 feet of her. Both her old location and her new location erupt into flames that persist for 1 minute. Anyone entering either flame must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 28 (`8d6`) fire damage.  

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The [Summoned Underlings](/Systems/5e/tables/archdevil-lair-action-list-summoned-underlings-coa.md) table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
