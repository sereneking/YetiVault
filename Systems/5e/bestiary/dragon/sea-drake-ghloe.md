# Sea Drake
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 51*

> Descendants of the great dragons of the mythic past still roam Etharis. They have little of the majesty of their ancestors, but they're still frightening.

## Salvage

Dragons are rare on Etharis, so materials from their corpses fetch a good price. A dragon's corpse can be sold for at least 100 gp times the Challenge of the monster.

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies can reduce the brain of a prismatic drake into an oil that can be used to fashion one arrow of dragon slaying. Brewing the oil takes 5 days of work, reagents worth 2,000 gp, and a successful DC 17 Intelligence or Wisdom check. Making the arrow is a trivial task, but treating it properly with the oil takes 5 more days of work.

## Lore

- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Sea drakes are cunning grapplers resistant to cold, sky drakes are adept fliers and have a bite charged with lightning, and blight drakes collect diseases that don't kill them but make for a toxic bite.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Prismatic drakes are the rarest drakes, rumored to be sorcerers transformed into dragons after they foolishly connected their minds to Gormadraug, the slumbering Prismatic Dragon. These drakes can cast spells.
