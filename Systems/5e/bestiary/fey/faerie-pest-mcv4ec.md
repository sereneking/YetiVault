# Faerie Pest
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Faerie pests love to cause annoyance, fear, and pain. They are perhaps the most mercurial of the faeries and are happy to follow anyone who promises the opportunity to menace someone new.

A faerie pest could be mistaken for a human toddler, except for the black-feathered wings sprouting from the faerie's shoulders. When engaged in combat, faerie pests wield thought-manipulating magic alongside sharp blades coated in stinging poison.

## Faeries

The faeries of Eldraine are winged, elfin creatures similar to sprites or pixies. Unpredictable, unreliable, and amoral, they lurk in the wilds and harass travelers they perceive as intruders.

> [!note] Ouphes
> 
> Ouphes are curious creatures found throughout the wilds of Eldraine. While often seen as foolish, ouphes are magically connected to the natural world and know more about the secret lives of trees, mushrooms, and moss than most mortals. While ouphes are related to Eldraine's faeries, the faeries treat them like distant (and somewhat embarrassing) cousins. Ouphes can be represented with the stat blocks for pixies or sprites.
