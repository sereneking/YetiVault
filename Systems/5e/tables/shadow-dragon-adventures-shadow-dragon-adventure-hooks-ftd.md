**Shadow Dragon Adventure Hooks**

`dice: [](shadow-dragon-adventures-shadow-dragon-adventure-hooks-ftd.md#^shadow-dragon-adventure-hooks)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A shadow dragon hunts the descendants of the miners who, centuries ago, uncovered the Shadowfell portal that caused the dragon's corruption. |
| 2 | A magical catastrophe has transported a town into the Underdark. The only path back to the surface goes directly through a shadow dragon's lair. |
| 3 | A young woman seeks heroes to retrieve a family heirloom stolen from her. The woman is actually a [night hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md), the heirloom is her heartstone, and the thief is a shadow dragon in Humanoid guise. |
| 4 | As war brews in a Material Plane world, a shrewd shadow dragon exploits a convergence with the Shadowfell to establish a cross-planar arms trade. |
| 5 | A hundred years ago, a savvy ruler bargained with a dragon to ensure the safety of the populace. The treaty is about to expire and must be renegotiated, but in the intervening century, the dragon has fallen to shadow. |
| 6 | A group of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) arrive at a city's gates, seeking refuge. They are fleeing the despotic rule of a shadow dragonâ€”but fail to mention that the dragon pursues them. |
| 7 | A shadow dragon has seized control of a city's criminal underworld. Those who want to depose the dragon face an army of assassins and Undead shadows. |
| 8 | Night after night, innocent folk are drained of their life's energy and rise as [shadows](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/shadow.md). A shadow dragon living in the area is suspected of the foul murders, but the real culprit is something else. |
