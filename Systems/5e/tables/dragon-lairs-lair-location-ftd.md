**Lair Location**

`dice: [](dragon-lairs-lair-location-ftd.md#^lair-location)`

| dice: d10 | Unusual Feature |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | The area is a climate anomaly—a cool and lush oasis in a hot desert, a balmy spring within a frozen tundra, a drifting iceberg in a warm sea, a barren waste in the midst of a verdant forest, or the like. |
| 2 | The area is a wild magic zone. Whenever a creature casts a spell of 1st level or higher or activates a magic item, roll a `d10`. On a 1, roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](/Systems/5e/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in the "Player's Handbook". |
| 3 | Natural rock formations align with celestial phenomena at particular times of the year. Stars and planets might line up with rock spires and windows on solstices and equinoxes, for example. |
| 4 | A dead god or titan is buried in the area. |
| 5 | The area is a vast crater, at the center of which is a long-buried meteorite. |
| 6 | A magical portal to another plane of existence releases dangerous energy—and sometimes creatures—into the area. |
| 7 | The area was a battlefield in an ancient war where thousands of soldiers were annihilated in a devastating magical assault. |
| 8 | Gravity does not function as expected in the area, which might manifest as giant floating earth motes or similar terrain. |
| 9 | An enormous tree—possibly the oldest living organism in the world—grows at the heart of the area. |
| 10 | A god left a profound impression on the site during an ancient visit to the Material Plane—perhaps a footprint, a pool of tears, or a splash of blood that has permanently infused the ground. |
