## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** Zalthar wields a [nine lives stealer](/Systems/5e/items/nine-lives-stealer.md) longsword with 5 charges remaining.

***Magic Resistance.*** Zalthar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Marshal Undead.*** Unless Zalthar is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), it and undead creatures of its choice within 60 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against features that turn undead.

***Spellcasting.*** Zalthar is a 19th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, `+10` to hit with spell attacks). It has the following paladin spells prepared:

**1st level (4 slots)**: [command](/Systems/5e/spells/command.md), [compelled duel](/Systems/5e/spells/compelled-duel.md), [searing smite](/Systems/5e/spells/searing-smite.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [magic weapon](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-weapon.md)

**3rd level (3 slots)**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [elemental weapon](/Systems/5e/spells/elemental-weapon.md)

**4th level (3 slots)**: [locate creature](/Systems/5e/spells/locate-creature.md), [staggering smite](/Systems/5e/spells/staggering-smite.md)

**5th level (2 slots)**: [destructive wave](/Systems/5e/spells/destructive-wave.md) (necrotic)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Zalthar makes three longsword attacks.

***Nine Lives Stealer Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`1d8 + 7`) slashing damage, or 12 (`1d10 + 7`) slashing damage if used with two hands, plus 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage.

***Hellfire Orb (1/Day).*** Zalthar hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes at a point it can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 35 (`10d6`) fire damage and 35 (`10d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Zalthar adds 6 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, Zalthar must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
