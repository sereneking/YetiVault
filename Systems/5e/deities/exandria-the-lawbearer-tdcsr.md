The driving inspiration behind many great inventions, the creation of vast cities, and law and order within society, the Lawbearer claims dominion over civilization. Judges and lawful rulers pay respect at her temples, which are central structures in major cities around the world. Peace and order—through structure and law—guide the will of her devout followers. The Lawbearer has a tempestuous romance with the Wildmother, a furious love that is only tempered when civilization and nature are in balance. Civil unrest and riots blossom within her beloved cities in these times of imbalance.

## Depiction

Illustrations and statues show the Lawbearer as a hooded, armored woman with light brown skin and a strong, lithe body, sitting atop a throne of pillars. Her face is generally obscured or depicted without expression, giving her presence an impartial yet imposing nature.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Lawbearer's clerics are granted powers of Knowledge or Order.

## Holy Day

The Lawbearer's holy day is Civilization's Dawn, and is celebrated on the autumnal equinox, usually the twenty-second day of the ninth month. In "Emon", each neighborhood celebrates by dancing around great bonfires in the square and giving gifts to celebrate their community.

- Utilize the company and aid of others. The efforts of the individual often pale against the capabilities of community.  
- Strive to tame the wilds in the name of civilization,and defend the points of light and order against the chaos of darkness.  
- Uphold and revere the spirit of invention. Create new settlements, build where inspiration strikes,and expand the edicts of the Lawbearer.
