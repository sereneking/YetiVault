# Molydeus
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 184, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 134*  

The fearsome molydeus speaks for the demon lord it serves and enforces its master's will. This demon is 12 feet tall, and its bipedal body has a slavering wolfs head and a fanged serpent's head. Its demon lord can speak and see through the serpent head; this master also uses the molydeus to guard treasures, slay foes, and terrify troops into obedience.

A molydeus's demon lord bestows on it a powerful weapon that dissolves if the molydeus dies. The weapon's form varies depending on the creator, but that doesn't affect the weapon's capabilities.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the molydeus fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The molydeus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The molydeus casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

**At will**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/polymorph.md), [telekinesis](/Systems/5e/spells/telekinesis.md), [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md)

**3/day**: [lightning bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/lightning-bolt.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon attack, one Snakebite attack, and one Wolf Bite attack.

***Demonic Weapon.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`4d12 + 9`) force damage. If the target has at least one head and the molydeus rolled a 20 on the attack roll, the target is decapitated and dies if it can't survive without that head. A target is immune to this effect if it takes none of the damage, has legendary actions, or is Huge or larger. Such a creature takes an extra 27 (`6d8`) force damage from the hit.

***Snakebite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (`2d6 + 9`) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target transforms into a [manes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/manes.md) if this reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This transformation can be ended only by a [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell.

***Wolf Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+16` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (`3d10 + 9`) necrotic damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** The molydeus makes one Demonic Weapon or Snakebite attack.

***Move.*** The molydeus moves without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The molydeus uses Spellcasting.
