# Keenness Of The Stone Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 7*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the physical talents emblematic of stone giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Stone Throw.** As a bonus action, you can touch a rock that can fit in the palm of your hand and imbue it with magic. While the rock is imbued with magic and you are wielding it, the rock is a magic ranged weapon with which you're proficient, and it has the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. On a hit, the rock deals `1d10` bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability increased by this feat) or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The magic remains in the rock until you hit with it or finish a long rest. You can imbue a number of rocks equal to your proficiency bonus with this bonus action, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  
- **Cavernous Sight.** You gain [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) from another source, its range increases by 60 feet.
