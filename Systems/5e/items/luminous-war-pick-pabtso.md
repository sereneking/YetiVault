# Luminous War Pick
*Melee Weapon, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: Martial
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The haft of this war pick is inlaid with crushed pearlescent stones that imbue the weapon with a faint luminescence. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this war pick.

While wielding the war pick, you can use a bonus action to cast the [daylight](/Systems/5e/spells/daylight.md) spell, choosing a point on the war pick. Once you use this bonus action, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
