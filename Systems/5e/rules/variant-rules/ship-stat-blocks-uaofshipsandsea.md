# Ship Stat Blocks
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 1* 

A ship's stat block gives game details for use when a ship is involved in combat or other situations where its defensive and offensive capabilities are relevant. The stat block has three main parts: basic statistics, action options, and the ship's components.

Ships can't take any actions on their own. Without any effort from its crew, a ship might drift on the water, come to a stop, or careen out of control.

## Basic Statistics

### Size

Most ships are Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. A ship's size category is determined by its length or width, whichever is longer. For instance, a ship that is 10 feet long and 20 feet wide would use the size category that has a 20-foot width, which means the ship is Gargantuan.

### Space

A ship doesn't have a square space unless its stat block specifies otherwise. For example, a ship that is 20 feet long and 10 feet wide occupies a 20-by-10-foot space.

A ship can't move into a space that is too small to accommodate it. If it tries to do so, it crashes, as described later in the "[Crashing a Ship](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/crashing-a-ship-uaofshipsandsea.md)" section.

### Capacity

A ship's stat block indicates how many creatures and how much cargo it can carry. Creatures include both the crew required to operate the vessel and any passengers who might ride along. Passengers could include marines who repel boarders and lead the attack on monsters and enemy ships.

### Travel Pace

A ship's travel pace determines how far the vessel can move per hour and per day. A ship's movement-related components (described later in the stat block) determine how far the vessel can move each round.

### Ability Scores

A ship has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and corresponding modifiers. A ship's Strength represents its size and weight. Dexterity represents a ship's ease of handling. A ship's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Ships usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a ship has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score.

### Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities

A ship's vulnerabilities, resistances, and immunities apply to all its components, unless otherwise noted in the stat block.

> If you're creating your own ship, they're usually immune to poison and psychic damage. Ones crafted from metal or stone are also typically immune to necrotic damage. They are also usually immune to the following conditions: [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified), [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned), and [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

## Components

A ship is composed of different components:

- **Hull.** A ship's hull is its basic frame, on which the other components are mounted.  
- **Control.** A control component is used to steer a ship.  
- **Movement.** A movement component is the element of the ship that enables it to move, such as a set of sails or oars.  
- **Weapon.** A ship capable of being used in combat has one or more weapon components, each of which is operated separately.  

A ship's component might have special rules, as described in the stat block.

### Armor Class

A component has an Armor Class. Its AC is meant to reflect its size, the materials used to construct it, and any defensive plating or armor used to augment its toughness.

### Hit Points

A ship component is destroyed and becomes unusable when it drops to 0 hit points. A ship is wrecked if its hull is destroyed. A ship component does not have Hit Dice.

### Damage Threshold

If a ship component has a damage threshold, that threshold appears after its hit points. A component has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn't reduce the component's hit points.

## Actions

This part of the stat block specifies what the ship can do on its turn, using its special actions rather than the actions used by creatures. It even relies on its actions to move; it doesn't have a move otherwise.
