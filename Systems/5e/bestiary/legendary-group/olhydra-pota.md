# Olhydra

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

Olhydra can command the waters around herself to take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Water, or in any elemental water node (such as the Plunging Torrents, described in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Olhydra uses her lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Pools of water in the lair surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- Water within 120 feet of Olhydra becomes murky and opaque until initiative count 20 of the next round. A creature with [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) can't see through the water, and light can't illuminate it.  
- A freezing fog fills a 40-foot-radius sphere within 120 feet of Olhydra, lasting until initiative count 20 of the next round. Creatures and objects within or beyond the fog are heavily obscured. A creature that enters the freezing cloud for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (`3d6`) cold damage.  

## Regional effects

Olhydra's presence in an elemental node creates a number of widespread effectsâ€”bad weather, strong tides, and increasing aggression from dangerous sea life.

- Violent downpours become frequent within 10 miles of the lair. A downpour occurs once every `2d12` hours, and lasts `1d3` hours. Downpours are so heavy that creatures moving overland travel at half normal speed  
- Within 5 miles of the lair, currents and tides are exceptionally strong and treacherous. Any ability checks made to safely navigate or control a vessel moving through these waters has disadvantage.  
- Aquatic creatures that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when they enter the area. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and attempts to leave the area, remaining [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) while within it. On a failure, the creature becomes highly aggressive and remains in the area for 24 hours. While in this state, the creature gains advantage on saving throws against charm and fear effects.  
- Natural springs and pools within 1 mile of the lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Water, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.  

If Olhydra is destroyed or banished back to her home plane, the regional effects fade over the next `1d10` days.
