# Merrenoloth

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while captaining a vessel, the merrenoloth can take one of the following lair actions; it can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Gale.** The air within 60 feet of the vessel is filled with wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- **Propel.** A strong wind propels the vessel, increasing its speed by 30 feet until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Repair.** The vessel regains 22 (`4d10`) hit points.  

## Regional effects

A merrenoloth imbues its vessel with magic that creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Unerring.** The vessel always stays on course to the destination the merrenoloth names.  
- **Unsinkable.** The vessel doesn't sink even if its hull is breached.  

If the merrenoloth dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d6` hours.
