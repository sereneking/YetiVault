# Fury of the Frost Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the icy might emblematic of frost giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Born of Ice.** You have resistance to cold damage.  
- **Frigid Vengeance.** When a creature hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to retaliate with a burst of magical ire. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the start of its next turn. You can use your reaction in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
