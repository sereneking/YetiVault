# Fazrian

## Lair actions
_Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage_

Unless he is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), Fazrian can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while on the Terminus Level:

- Blood flows from Fazrian's eyes until initiative count 20 on the next round. No creature within 120 feet of the planetar can regain hit points until the effect ends.  
- Fazrian's eyes become smoldering black voids until initiative count 20 on the next round. All other creatures within 120 feet of the planetar have disadvantage on saving throws until the effect ends.  
- Blinding magical light springs from Fazrian's eyes until initiative count 20 on the next round. If a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the planetar and the two of them can see each other, Fazrian can force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded). The blindness lasts until the creature receives a [lesser restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.
