# Lesser Demon
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 184*  

For those still new to the art of summoning, a fumbled attempt to conjure forth an entity of great power often results in the appearance of a lesser demon in its place. These beings are lowly, vexing creatures, eager to sow discord wherever they have been called.

## Vile and Malicious

While there are all manner of devils and demons that seek to terrorize the good folk of the world, others are more off-putting and disgusting—an embarrassing blunder for the fledgling witch or wizard whose invocation went awry. Although not particularly powerful, lesser demons can still pose a serious threat to inexperienced conjurors and unsuspecting civilians.

## Traits

***Multiattack.*** The demon makes two attacks, one with its bite and one with its claws.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Foul Odor (1/day).*** The demon emits a cloud of poisonous gas that fills a 20-foot sphere and persists for 1 minute until it disperses into the surrounding air. The cloud spreads around corners, and the affected area is heavily obscured. Any creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw against the poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action on that turn retching and reeling. Creatures immune to poison are immune to this effect. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) will disperse it after 1 round.
