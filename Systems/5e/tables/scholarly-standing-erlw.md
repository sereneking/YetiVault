**Scholarly Standing**

`dice: [](scholarly-standing-erlw.md#^scholarly-standing)`

| dice: d6 | Standing |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | **Revolutionary**. Your work has upended scholarly consensus and reshaped the way other academics think about your field. Each new discovery you make is received with acclaim. |
| 2 | **Respected**. Your work is considered noteworthy, though not revolutionary. Scholars in your field follow your writing and efforts with interest. |
| 3 | **Anonymous**. Try as you might, you can't earn positive or negative attention. Even worse, after you've published your findings, more prominent scholars have made similar statements to much acclaim. |
| 4 | **Misguided**. Your theories challenge scholarly consensus and are discounted. A prominent scholar argues against your conclusions, and their voice carries the day... for now. |
| 5 | **Fringe**. You work on the edges of your field, advocating bizarre theories that challenge scholarly consensus and seem patently outrageous, even scandalous. |
| 6 | **Fraud**. For right or wrong, many in the academic community believe you have invented at least some of your "findings" to earn attention. |
