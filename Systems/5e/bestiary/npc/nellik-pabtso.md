## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Nellik has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Nellik's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Nellik's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. Nellik can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [mirror image](/Systems/5e/spells/mirror-image.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Nellik makes two melee attacks, or it makes one melee attack and teleports before or after the attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`2d4`) slashing damage at the start of each of its turns due to a fiendish wound. Each time Nellik hits the wounded target with this attack, the damage dealt by the wound increases by 5 (`2d4`). Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

***Greataxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`2d12 + 6`) slashing damage; if the target is an Aberration, it takes an additional 6 (`1d12`) slashing damage, and if it is grappling a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or its grapple ends.

***Teleport.*** Nellik magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
