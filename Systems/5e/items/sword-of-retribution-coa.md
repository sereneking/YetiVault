# Sword of Retribution
*Generic Variant, very rare (requires attunement)*  


You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword. Hit points lost to this weapon's damage can be regained only through a short or long rest, rather than by regeneration, magic, or any other means.

## Curse

You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. While attuned to this weapon, you also have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

The vengeful spirit possessing the sword shares its history and lust for vengeance with the wielder. After each successful long rest, you experience nightmares of the spirit's past, culminating in its death. When you wake, you must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you only gain the benefits of a short rest. Only the [Remove Curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

## Corrupting

This item corrupts. See the "Infernal Item Corruption" section.
