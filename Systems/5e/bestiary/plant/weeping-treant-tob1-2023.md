# Weeping Treant
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 369*  

*This twisted tree's face is made of cracked, black bark knotted into vaguely humanoid features, and thick tears of sap run down its face.*

Weeping treants clearly are related to other treants, but they are smaller than the normal variety. Their gnarled trunks are twisted, and their wood often groans when they move.

## Forest Wardens

Weeping treants are protectors of dark, shadowy forests—particularly forests in the Plane of Shadow—and they are as long-lived as the trees themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for something specific within the forest, and they have no pity for those carrying axes or fire.

## Skeptical Mein

Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow world, and they're notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.

## Enchanted Bitter Tears

Sages and scholars debate why these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with a compelling reason beyond "it's what trees do." The weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the matter. Their tears are occasionally components in druidic spells or items.
