# Alchemist
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 4*  

You have studied the secrets of alchemy and are an expert in its practice, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with [alchemist's supplies](/Systems/5e/items/alchemists-supplies.md). If you are already proficient with them, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with them.  
- As an action, you can identify one potion within 5 feet of you, as if you had tasted it. You must see the liquid for this benefit to work.  
- Over the course of any short rest, you can temporarily improve the potency of one [potion of healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing.md) of any rarity. To use this benefit, you must have [alchemist's supplies](/Systems/5e/items/alchemists-supplies.md) with you, and the potion must be within reach. If the potion is drunk no more than 1 hour after the short rest ends, the creature drinking the potion can forgo the potion's die roll and regains the maximum number of hit points that the potion can restore.
