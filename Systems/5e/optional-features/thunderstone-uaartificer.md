# Thunderstone
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 6*  

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a crystalline shard and hurl it at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the shard disappears if you don't hurl it by the end of the current turn). The shard shatters on impact with a blast of concussive energy. Each creature within 10 feet of the point of impact must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) and pushed 10 feet away from that point.
