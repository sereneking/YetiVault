## Traits

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, Diva Luma has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Diva Luma scores against a [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Diva Luma is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Diva Luma instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** Diva Luma deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Diva Luma that isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and Diva Luma doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Diva Luma makes two high-heeled shoe attacks.

***High-Heeled Shoe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.
