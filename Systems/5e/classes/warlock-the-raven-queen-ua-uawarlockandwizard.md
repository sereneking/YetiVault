# The Raven Queen (UA)
*[Warlock](warlock.md): Otherworldly Patron*

## Class Features

### The Raven Queen (Level 1)

Your patron is the Raven Queen, a mysterious being who rules the Shadowfell from a palace of ice deep within that dread realm. The Raven Queen watches over the world, anticipating each creature's death and ensuring that it meets its end at the proscribed time and place. As the ruler of the Shadowfell, she dwells in a decayed, dark reflection of the world. Her ability to reach into the world is limited. Thus, she turns to mortal warlocks to serve her will. Warlocks sworn to the Raven Queen receive visions and whispers from her in their dreams, sending them on quests and warning them of impending dangers.

The Raven Queen's followers are expected to serve her will in the world. She concerns herself with ensuring that those fated to die pass from the world as expected, and bids her agents to defeat those who seek to cheat death through undeath or other imitations of immortality. She hates intelligent undead and expects her followers to strike them down, whereas mindless undead such as skeletons and zombies are little more than stumbling automatons in her eyes.

### Sentinel Raven (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, you gain the service of a spirit sent by the Raven Queen to watch over you. The spirit assumes the form and game statistics of a [raven](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/raven.md), and it always obeys your commands, which you can give telepathically while it is within 100 feet of you.

While the raven is perched on your shoulder, you gain [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) with a range of 30 feet and a bonus to your passive Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score and to Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier. While perched on your shoulder, the raven can't be targeted by any attack or other harmful effect; only you can cast spells on it; it can't take damage; and it is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

You can see through the raven's eyes and hear what it hears while it is within 100 feet of you. In combat, you roll initiative for the raven and control how it acts. If it is slain by a creature, you gain advantage on all attack rolls against the killer for the next 24 hours.

The raven doesn't require sleep. While it is within 100 feet of you, it can awaken you from sleep as a bonus action. The raven vanishes when it dies, if you die, or if the two of you are separated by more than 5 miles.

At the end of a short or long rest, you can call the raven back to you—no matter where it is or whether it died—and it reappears within 5 feet of you.

### Soul of the Raven (Level 6)

At 6th level, you gain the ability to merge with your raven spirit. As a bonus action when your raven is perched on your shoulder, your body merges with your raven's form. While merged, you become Tiny, you replace your speed with the raven's, and you can use your action only to [Dash](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Disengage), [Dodge](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dodge), [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help), [Hide](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Hide), or [Search](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Search). During this time, you gain the benefits of your raven being perched on your shoulder. As an action, you and the raven return to normal.

### Raven's Shield (Level 10)

At 10th level, the Raven Queen grants you a protective blessing. You gain advantage on death saving throws, immunity to the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition, and resistance to necrotic damage.

### Queen's Right Hand (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you can channel the Raven Queen's power to slay a creature. You can cast [finger of death](/Systems/5e/spells/finger-of-death.md). After you cast the spell with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
