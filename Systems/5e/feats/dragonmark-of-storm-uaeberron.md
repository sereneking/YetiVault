# Dragonmark of Storm
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Eberron p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: [Half-Elf](/Systems/5e/races/half-elf.md)

You have the magical mark of Storm, the dragonmark of House Lyrander, and are a member of that house.

You gain the ability to innately cast spells and cantrips, using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability. You cast each spell at its lowest level. Once you cast a given spell this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it innately again. You must still expend any material components. Your dragonmark confers the following benefits:

## Least Dragonmark

When you first take this feat, you gain the least dragonmark. You learn the following spells: [fog cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md), [shocking grasp](/Systems/5e/spells/shocking-grasp.md)

## Lesser Dragonmark

At 5th level and higher, your mark becomes more potent, improving to lesser dragonmark. You learn the following spell: [gust of wind](/Systems/5e/spells/gust-of-wind.md)

## Greater Dragonmark

At 9th level and higher, your mark's power increases again, becoming a greater dragonmark. You learn the following spell: [sleet storm](/Systems/5e/spells/sleet-storm.md)
