# Armor of Tools
*Source: UA2020SubclassesPt3 p. 3*  

As an action, a creature wearing this infused armor can integrate into it artisan's tools or [thieves' tools](/Systems/5e/items/thieves-tools.md). The tools remain integrated in the armor for 8 hours or until the wearer removes the tools as an action. The armor can have only one tool integrated at a time.

The wearer can add its Intelligence modifier to any ability checks it makes with the integrated tool. The wearer must have a hand free to use the tool.
