|----------|-------|
| 1 | On a quiet night, the tavern door bursts open and a group of soldiers calls for one of the party members by name. |
| 2 | An explosion rocks a market, sending things flying. |
| 3 | A vehicle crashes near the party: people are hurt and need help, and whatever caused the crash is still around somewhere. |
| 4 | Two groups of people start fighting each other, blood is drawn, and bystanders are getting hurt. |
| 5 | Chanting words of the Draconic Prophecy, a dragon appears and starts causing mayhem. |
| 6 | A tavern patron suddenly leaps up and attacks one of the adventurers, scratching and biting in blind fury. |
