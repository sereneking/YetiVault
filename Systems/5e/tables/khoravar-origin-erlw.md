| dice: d10 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | You're the linchpin of a Khoravar community in a major city, hosting unity meals and maintaining connections with every half-elf in the city. |
| 2 | You grew up in a small town dominated by humans. You didn't know any other half-elves, and you did your best to fit in. |
| 3 | You lived in the Eldeen Reaches as part of a small Khoravar community, trying to be a bridge between the human farmers in the east and the druids and wilder folk in the west. |
| 4 | Your small Khoravar community has only survived in the slums of Sharn through the close, family-like support you show each other. |
| 5 | You're part of a community in Thrane whose devotion to the Silver Flame has led you to extend your unity meals to non-Khoravar. |
| 6 | Your Khoravar community is the crew of a Lhazaar ship. |
| 7 | You're part of a tiny Khoravar community in Karrnath that's fascinated with death and the practices of your Aereni ancestors, transforming your unity meals into grim celebrations of death. |
| 8 | You're part of a tiny community of Khoravar living in an unexpected place, such as Droaam, Darguun, or even the Demon Wastes. Your people strive to find common ground with the native population. |
| 9 | You are associated with House Lyrandar or House Medani, but you're more interested in the role the house plays in supporting Khoravar communities than in the work of its guilds. |
| 10 | You ride with the Valenar, hoping one day to prove that you are worthy of taking on a patron ancestor. |
