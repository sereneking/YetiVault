# Sinensa
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 45*  

Myconids are intelligent, mobile fungi that live in caves, seek enlightenment, and dislike violence. Adult myconids live and work together in colonies and practice a form of communal meditation called a meld, in which they seek to transcend mundane reality through shared hallucination.

Myconid leaders like Sinensa use their Hallucination Spores to help myconids create melds.

## Traits

***Distress Spores.*** When Sinensa takes damage, all other myconids within 240 feet of it can sense its pain.

***Sun Sickness.*** While in sunlight, Sinensa has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. Sinensa dies if it spends more than 1 hour in direct sunlight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The myconid makes one Fist attack and uses its Hallucination Spores.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`3d4 + 1`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Hallucination Spores.*** Sinensa ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) while it hallucinates. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Rapport Spores.*** A 30-foot radius of spores extends from Sinensa. These spores can go around corners and affect only creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or higher that aren't undead, constructs, or elementals. Affected creatures can communicate telepathically with one another while they are within 30 feet of each other. The effect lasts for 1 hour.
