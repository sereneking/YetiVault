| 1 | The previous owner, a vampire, will hunt down the purchasers in `1d4` weeks |
| 2 | The item requires two attunement slots (if the item does not normally require attunement, it now requires one) |
| 3 | After `2d4` days, the item disappears, returning to the Shadar-Kai's store |
| 4 | A commoner will find the new owner after `1d4` weeks and explain the item was stolen from her and that she needs the money from selling it or else her family will starve |
| 5 | The item is part of a game between two rakshasa. They gamble to see how long each owner of the item survives after obtaining it. Within `3d6` days one of the rakshasa will attempt to kill the owner |
| 6 | Within `1d6` weeks an adult gold dragon will confront the new owner when she recognizes the item as belonging to the lair of her recently slain child |
| 7 | 1 week after first obtaining the item, the new owner loses `4d4` from their hit point maximum until a [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell is cast upon the item |
| 8 | Within `1d6` days of purchasing the item, it becomes a normal version of its base item |
| 9 | Each day the item changes to a random color |
| 10 | The item begins to stink after `1d4` weeks, giving disadvantage to anyone within 10 ft. making Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks involving smell. |
