# Goat-Man
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 214*  

*This hunched, man-like figure lurches with a strange, half-hopping gait. Tattered clothing hangs from its muscled shoulders, and its legs are those of a ram, ending in cloven hooves.*

## Trespassers on the Rites

The first of the goat-men was the victim of a powerful curse intended to punish him for spying on magical rites exclusive to the women of his tribe. Admiring the grotesque result, the Black Goat of the Woods With a Thousand Young adopted him as its servant, and ensured that all who committed the same taboo fell to the same curse, and thus into the Black Goat's service.

## Bleating Speech

A goat-man's head is tusked, adorned with curling ram's horns, and its beard often drips with gore. Rows of transparent, needle-like, malformed teeth fill its mouth, making clear speech impossible for goat-men.

## Serve Foul Cults

Cultists of Shub-Niggurath or the Black Goat in good standing are sometimes granted the services of a goat-man. The creatures guard ritual sites, visit settlements to capture or purchase suitable sacrifices, and perform certain unspeakable acts with cult members to call forth ritual magic.
