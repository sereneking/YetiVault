# Summon Bestial Spirit
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a feather, tuft of fur, and fish tail inside a gilded acorn worth at least 200 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth the spirit of a beast. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Bestial Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an environment: Air, Land, or Water. The creature physically resembles an animal of your choice that is native to the chosen environment, which also determines one of the movement modes in the creature's stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell's duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md)
