# Archon of Redemption
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 22*  

Like angels, archons are incarnations of white mana. They serve the archangels as embodiments of white mana's harsher aspects: a rigid sense of justice and a ruthless execution of punishment for those who defy the law. The appearance of the archons is deceptive: they look like hooded humans riding winged lions, but they are single creatures with just one mind and will.

An archon's game statistics are nearly identical to those of a [deva](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/deva.md).

## Traits

***Angelic Weapons.*** The archon's weapon attacks are magical. When the archon hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `3d8` radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Axiomatic Mind.*** The archon can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its understanding of justice.

***Magic Resistance.*** The archon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***One Being.*** Though it appears as a humanoid creature riding a mount, an archon is a single being. The "rider" can't be dismounted, and no other means can separate the two portions of the archon's being short of its death.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The archon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). The archon can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md)

**1/day each**: [destructive wave](/Systems/5e/spells/destructive-wave.md), [geas](/Systems/5e/spells/geas.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The archon makes two attacks: one with its sword and one with its claws.

***Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage plus 13 (`3d8`) radiant damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 13 (`3d8`) radiant damage.
