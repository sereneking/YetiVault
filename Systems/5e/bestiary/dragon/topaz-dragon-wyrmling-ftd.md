# Topaz Dragon Wyrmling
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 223*  

Decay and despair are bound up in the nature of topaz dragons, thanks to the necrotic energy of the Negative Plane that suffuses them. Their psionic power manifests the fundamental entropic principle that mortal beings and their creations are ultimately doomed to death and decomposition, and the dragons' demeanor is typically morbid and curmudgeonly as a result.

## Gleaming Gold

Upon hatching, topaz dragon wyrmlings' scales are dull yellow-orange and have a cloudy or filmy look. As they age, their scales harden and clarify, becoming translucent and faceted, and ranging from bright yellow to rich amber in color. Their bodies are wider at the haunches, tapering in a wedge shape toward the head, and their wings are shaped to propel them through both air and water. A topaz dragon's psionic power manifests visibly in the gem-like spines that run in a ridge from the crown of the head to the tip of the tail. These spines hover above a living topaz dragon's back, dancing and shifting with the dragon's mood.

## Embodiment of Decay

While generally not malicious, topaz dragons embody decay. They view destruction as a natural means of clearing the way for new creation and growth, much as a forest fire clears dead wood, replenishes the soil, and allows the forest to regrow even healthier than before. To this end, topaz dragons use their power to reduce crumbling structures and diseased plants to dust, clearing the way for new growth and construction.

Despite being competent swimmers and making their lairs on seacoasts and in brackish marshes, topaz dragons hate the water. Unfortunately, their favorite food is giant squid, so these dragons have ample opportunity to complain bitterly about being wet after diving deep into the ocean in search of prey.

Topaz dragons often come into conflict with bronze dragons when their coastal territories overlap, and they can nurture an inexplicably intense hatred of these metallic dragons. They can also draw the ire of druids and other nature protectors who don't understand the dragons' proclivity for destroying large swaths of countryside. Beyond that, topaz dragons dislike company and grow irritated when disturbed. But anyone who can endure their abrasive demeanor, caustic observations, and morbid interests can form a lasting bond with a powerful ally.

## Entropic Hoards

Topaz dragons prize information on destruction and creation, whether abstract or dedicated to practical applications. They are fascinated by magic that creates objects from nothing, animates Undead, destroys matter, or manipulates negative energy. And they are particularly intrigued by Undead, sometimes keeping them in their hoards as curios.

### Connected Creatures

Topaz dragons rarely tolerate any company but their own, and they are usually indifferent at best even toward their own kind. Moreover, their unpredictability means that even if a creature proves itself useful to a topaz dragon, it shouldn't count on being safe from the dragon the next time they meet. Topaz dragons rarely go out of their way to fight other creatures, however, with the exception of bronze dragons, for whom they bear an inexplicably intense hatred.

**1/day each**: [bane](/Systems/5e/spells/bane.md)

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage plus 2 (`1d4`) necrotic damage.

***Desiccating Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales yellowish necrotic energy in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage and is weakened until the end of its next turn. A weakened creature has disadvantage on Strength-based ability checks and Strength saving throws, and the creature's weapon attacks that rely on Strength deal half damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't weakened.
