***Magic Weapons.*** Ulamog's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Ulamog's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, `+15` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md), [water walk](/Systems/5e/spells/water-walk.md)

## Actions

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (`6d6 + 10`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of Ulamog's next turn.

***Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+15` to hit, range 600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`7d6`) damage of one of the following types (empyrean's choice): acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, radiant, or thunder.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Ulamog makes one attack.

***Bolster.*** Ulamog bolsters all nonhostile creatures within 120 feet of it until the end of its next turn. Bolstered creatures can't be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and they gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws until the end of Ulamog's next turn.

***Trembling Strike (Costs 2 Actions).*** Ulamog strikes the ground with its maul, triggering an earth tremor. All other creatures on the ground within 60 feet of Ulamog must succeed on a DC 25 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
