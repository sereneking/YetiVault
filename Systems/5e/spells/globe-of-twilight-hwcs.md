# Globe of Twilight
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-feet sphere)
- **Components:** V, S, a dab of pitch and a bag of glittering sand
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minute

You shroud the area surrounding you in a sphere of night sky, dotted with miniature stars. The twilight conceals your allies, but clearly illuminates your enemies.

The area affected by this spell is lightly obscured by magical shadow, within which small constellations softly twinkle. Aside from these stars, only light produced by a spell of 3rd level or higher can properly illuminate any area inside the sphere. Nonmagical light does not function inside the sphere, and all other forms of magical radiance can only produce dim light in a 5-foot space.

When you cast this spell you may designate any number of creatures you can see to be concealed by the supernatural shadows while in the sphere. A concealed creature has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks when inside the sphere and may attempt to hide at any time. Because the area of the spell is lightly obscured, creatures within the spell's area have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see those outside of it.

All other creatures in the area are dazzled by the light of the miniature stars, causing them to have disadvantage on all perception checks inside the sphere. When such a creature enters the spell's area for the first time, or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of its turn.
