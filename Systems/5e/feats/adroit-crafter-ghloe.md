# Adroit Crafter
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis*  

**Prerequisite**: Proficiency in a skill or tool

You've trained in crafting items using a skill or tool that you're proficient with, and the steps in crafting have become second nature to you. You gain the following benefits:

- The time it takes to create an item using your proficient skills or tools is halved.  
- If you fail to successfully craft the item and would lose the components, you retain the components instead.
