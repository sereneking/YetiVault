Solinari, the god of good magic, is patron of the Mages of High Sorcery's Order of the White Robes and other benevolent mages. His power manifests through the white moon of Krynn, the brightest of its three moons. Along with his cousins Lunitari and Nuitari, he watches Krynn from the heavens and encourages magic that aids, heals, and protects.
