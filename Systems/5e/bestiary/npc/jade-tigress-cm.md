## Reactions

***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, Jade Tigress deflects the missile. The damage she takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 9`. If the damage is reduced to 0, Jade Tigress catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and Jade Tigress has a hand free.
