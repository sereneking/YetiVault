# Downtime and Franchise Activity: Philanthropic Enterprise
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 41* 

It can feel great to give to charity and help those in need. Pretending to care about others can also be a great way to earn favor with governments and nobility, gain tax write-offs, or win over customers. Head Office might suggest (or even require) that a franchise undertake this activity if it has recently gained negative publicity or been discovered to engage in shady activities.

Franchise members should select a philanthropic cause related to a nearby area, settlement, or group of people. Example causes include such efforts as picking up trash from roads or forests, improving schools, and raising funds for victims of a recent disaster. (That last one is an especially good idea if the disaster was caused by the franchise). Success benefits the franchise by helping the selected cause—or at least giving the appearance of having done so. Failure might worsen both the underlying issue and the franchise's reputation.

## Resources

The philanthropic exercise activity requires at least one workweek of effort, and incurs 50 gp per franchise rank in expenses.

## Resolution

One character or staff member involved in the philanthropic enterprise makes an ability check determined by the DM. A Charisma check using the character's choice of skill is often appropriate, but the DM might decide that a specific philanthropic approach requires a different ability and skill. A character with the documancer or occultant position gains a +1 bonus to the check. The total of the check determines the outcome, as shown on the Philanthropic Enterprise table.

**Philanthropic Enterprise**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–5 | The philanthropic enterprise is a disaster. The cause is left severely worse off, and literally everyone blames the franchise. |
| 6–10 | The cause shows no real improvement, and people are slow to accept the franchise's claims of wanting to help. |
| 11–15 | The franchise is praised for its help in improving the chosen cause. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim an honorarium of 200 gp. |
| 16–20 | The cause shows serious improvement, and the franchise is heralded for its actions. Donations to the cause pour in, allowing the franchise to skim a management fee of 500 gp. |
| 21+ | The cause shows remarkable improvement, and the franchise is credited for all but fully resolving the issue. Local officials provide a tax break, reducing the franchise's monthly costs by 20 percent for 2 months. |

## Complications

A result of 1–5 on the Philanthropic Enterprise table automatically generates a complication. But the DM can decide that even success might have drawbacks, either choosing or rolling for a complication on the Philanthropic Enterprise Complications table.

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | The selected cause is secretly the purview of a thieves' guild or other criminal organization. The organization resents the franchise's efforts and decides to undermine the characters' future endeavors.* |
| 2 | A local reporter or official becomes convinced that the franchise's efforts are all about the characters' personal gain. The individual begins to monitor the franchise, and reports on any missteps.* |
| 3 | A group of individuals objects to the franchise's efforts, believing that the problem underlying the selected cause is part of the natural order. The group actively tries to convince others of the terrible side effects (real or otherwise) of the franchise's philanthropy.* |
| 4 | Another philanthropic group is already involved in the franchise's cause. That group tries to cast the franchise's efforts as ineffective and insincere.* |
| 5 | Hearing of the franchise's good works, people who are affected by some other issue requiring philanthropic assistance show up at franchise headquarters in huge numbers. |
| 6 | Members of the franchise work with an established group to perform the philanthropic enterprise. But it soon becomes clear that the group is a sham—and that local officials are looking into their activities. The characters need to fix the situation, or risk being implicated in scandal by association.* |
