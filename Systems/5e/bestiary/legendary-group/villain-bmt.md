# Villain

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while in its lair, the villain can take one of the following lair actions; the villain can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Distraction.** A shrill sound fills the lair. Creatures that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.  
- **Snares.** Hidden snares target up to three creatures the villain can see in the lair. Each creature must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the grappled condition (escape DC 15) and the restrained condition until it escapes or the snare holding it is destroyed. Each snare has AC 11, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.  
- **Traps.** Traps target up to two creatures the villain can see in the lair. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a trap. The villain rolls a number of d6s equal to its proficiency bonus, and struck targets take damage equal to the total. The damage is bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, fire, or poison, chosen by the villain when the villain uses this action.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a villain's lair is warped by their presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Corruption Abounds.** While within 3 miles of the lair, creatures that aren't members of the villain's organization have disadvantage on ability checks that rely on the Insight, Perception, and Persuasion skills.  
- **Potent Toxins.** When members of the villain's organization deal poison damage while within 3 miles of the lair, they ignore the target's resistance to poison damage.  

If the villain dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
