# Baleful Scion
*Source: Sigil and the Outlands p. 10*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You can channel cosmic forces of evil to gain these benefits:

- **Grasp of Avarice.** Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can also deal necrotic damage to it. The necrotic damage equals `1d6` + your proficiency bonus, and you regain a number of hit points equal to this necrotic damage dealt. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
