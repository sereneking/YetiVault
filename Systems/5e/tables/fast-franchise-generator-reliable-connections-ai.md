| dice: d8 | Connection |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | **Kim the Kid**: The best fence in town. |
| 2 | **Jeremy Snoot**: The most easily intimidated customs official in the city. From blueprints of government buildings to shipping manifests, he's your halfling. |
| 3 | **York Battleby**: A dab hand at knitting and swinging a sword. He takes payment in liquor for either service. |
| 4 | **Diana Fenwick**: Noble who wants to play criminal; enthusiastic, inexperienced, and loaded. |
| 5 | **"G"**: The only thing known about this information broker is the dead-drop point where they exchange messages, and that they're never wrong. |
| 6 | **Teresa Clearlake**: If you're looking for a place to lie low, her funeral home is ideal. |
| 7 | **Jenkin Twotooth**: Always has a job for those looking to scrape together a few coins. Unfortunately, his teeth outnumber his scruples. |
| 8 | **"Mustard" Micah**: Famous for being able to get goods and people past any blockade. Provided you don't mind said goods or people smelling strongly of mustard for the next month. |
