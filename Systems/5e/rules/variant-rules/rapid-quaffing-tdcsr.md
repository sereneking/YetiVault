# Rapid Quaffing
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 215* 

This house rule lets characters grab and drink a potion as a bonus action, enabling them to heal or buff up in combat without sacrificing their primary attacks or spellcasting to do so. (This applies to enemies and NPCs as well as player characters!)

Using this house rule, you can use a bonus action to drink a potion yourself. It still requires an action to administer a potion to another creature. You can also choose to only apply this house rule to [potions of healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing.md) and their [variants](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing-gv.md) ([potion of greater healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-greater-healing.md), etc.). In this less powerful version of the house rule, you can consume a potion that restores hit points as a bonus action, but all other potions still require you to use your action.
