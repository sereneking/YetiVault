# Scaladar
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 315*  

Scaladar are constructs created by Trobriand, one of Halaster's apprentices. They move and attack like giant scorpions, grabbing prey with two large pincer claws and delivering a deadly pulse of lightning with their metal stinger tails.

***Lightning Absorption.*** Whenever the scaladar is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage, and its sting deals an extra 11 (`2d10`) lightning damage until the end of its next turn.

***Scaladar Link.*** The scaladar knows the location of other scaladar within 100 feet of it, and it can sense when any of them take damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d12 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). The scaladar has two claws, each of which can grapple one target.
