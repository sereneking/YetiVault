**Dragon Flaws and Secrets**

`dice: [](dragon-characters-dragon-flaws-and-secrets-ftd.md#^dragon-flaws-and-secrets)`

| dice: d10 | Flaw or Secret |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | I find adventurers fearsome, and I'm convinced that I'll meet my doom at their hands one day. |
| 2 | One item in my possession is worth as much as the rest of my hoard combined, and the fear that it might be stolen consumes me. |
| 3 | Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep. |
| 4 | I would rather let my fearsome reputation scare away intruders than fight them off. |
| 5 | Other dragons would scorn me if they knew how fondly I regard my minions. They're so cute! |
| 6 | I am terrified of creatures from the Outer Planesâ€”especially modrons. |
| 7 | Another dragon has sworn to find and destroy me. |
| 8 | Humanoids are not ready to learn the horrible cosmic truths in the books in my hoard. |
| 9 | The prospect of living for centuries more exhausts me. |
| 10 | I'm convinced that a version of me on a different world in the Material Plane is hoping to destroy me and steal my hoard. |
