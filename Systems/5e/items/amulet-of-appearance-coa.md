# Amulet of Appearance
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


Your armor, weapons, and other equipment always shine as if just polished. Even if you're wounded, your wounds do not appear to others. You're immune to the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions, as these would otherwise ruin your elegant appearance. However, whenever you would otherwise have been affected by one of these conditions, a random non-evil Humanoid on the Material Plane whom you have previously met gets the condition instead. You know this.
