# Imix

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

Imix is master of heat and flames in his vicinity. He can take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or in any elemental fire node (such as the Weeping Colossus in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Imix uses his lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Any fires in the lair flare up drastically, quadrupling in size (for example, a fire blazing in a 5-foot by 5-foot area expands to a 10-foot by 10-foot area). Pools or streams of lava or other molten material are also affected. Creatures caught in the area of an expanded fire are subject to the normal damage for entering or being in the fire. Creatures caught by a sudden flood of lava must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), in addition to the normal damage for contact with molten rock.  
- A thick cloud of black smoke and burning embers fills a 40-foot-radius sphere within 120 feet of Imix, lasting until initiative count 20 of the next round. Creatures and objects within or beyond the smoke are heavily obscured. A creature that enters the cloud of embers for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage.  
- A [wave](/Systems/5e/items/wave.md) of searing heat fills the lair in a 300-foot radius around Imix for an instant. Each creature other than Imix in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take `1d8` fire damage. Creatures that take fire damage from this effect gain one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). In addition, there is a fifty percent chance that any container of fluid held or carried by an affected creature (for example, a magic potion) is destroyed.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

The region containing an elemental node in which Imix is present becomes vulnerable to the influence of fire. This creates the following effects:

- A dry, baking heat [wave](/Systems/5e/items/wave.md) strikes the region within 10 miles of Imix's location. At first, effects are minor - grass turns brown, animals become listless, work and travel become very tiring. The longer Imix remains, the worse the heat becomes; after 5 days, crops die and ponds dry up; after 10 days, unprotected livestock dies, and wells and small rivers dry up; after 20 days, large lakes and rivers are reduced in depth by 20 feet and shrink accordingly.  
- Wildfires erupt within a 5-mile radius of Imix's lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in this area are caught in the path of a wildfire moving 50 feet per round. Each character must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. A wildfire continues to threaten the characters for `1d10` rounds or until they get out of its path. Wooden structures caught in the wildfire are destroyed.  
- Lava fountains erupt from the ground within 1 mile of Imix's lair. Every hour, there is a ten percent chance that characters in this area are close enough to an erupting lava fountain to be in danger. A lava fountain creates a vent 20 feet in diameter, and hurls globs of lava up to 200 feet away. Each character within this area must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (`5d6`) fire damage. A fountain lasts for `2d10` rounds before subsiding.  
- Wildfires or volcanic fissures within 1 mile of Imix's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.  

If Imix is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next `1d10` days.
