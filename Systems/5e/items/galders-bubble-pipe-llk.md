# Galder's Bubble Pipe
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This finely carved pipe blows odorless bubbles instead of smoke when used. The pipe has 3 charges, and it regains all spent charges daily at dawn. While you hold the pipe, you can expend charges to gain access to the following properties:

- You can cast [fog cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md) as an action (1 charge).  
- You can cast [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md) as a bonus action (2 charges).  
- You can summon a [steam mephit](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/steam-mephit.md) as an action (3 charges). The mephit is friendly to you, obeys your verbal commands, and acts on its own turn in the initiative order. It disappears in a harmless puff of steam after 1 minute or if it ends its turn more than 60 feet from the pipe.
