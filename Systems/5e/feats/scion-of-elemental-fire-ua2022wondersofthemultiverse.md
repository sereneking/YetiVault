# Scion Of Elemental Fire
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 9*  

You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Plane of Fire, granting you the following benefits:

- **Elemental Magic.** You learn the [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md) cantrip, using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (choose when you select this feat).  
- **Fervent Blaze.** You learn the [produce flame](/Systems/5e/spells/produce-flame.md) cantrip, using the same spellcasting ability chosen for this feat's Elemental Magic benefit. You can cast produce flame as normal, and you can also cast it as a bonus action a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
