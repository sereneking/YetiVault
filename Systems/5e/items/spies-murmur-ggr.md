# Spies' Murmur
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This headpiece, crafted from dark metal, is worn curved around the ear. If you know a creature wearing another Spies' Murmur and that creature is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate telepathically with each other. As a bonus action, you can allow that creature to hear everything you hear for 1 hour. You can end this effect as a bonus action, and it ends if you're [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).
