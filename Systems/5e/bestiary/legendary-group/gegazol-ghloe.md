# Gegazol

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gegazol takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. Gegazol can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Tendrils of necrotic power rise and reach for living creatures within the lair. Each living creature in the lair must attempt a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (`3d8`) necrotic damage and gain one level of exhaustion until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Gegazol crashes her wings upon the ground, and rime spreads in a sphere with a 120-foot radius around her. This sphere spreads around corners and creates difficult terrain made of ice. Creatures in that area must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. Those who fail take 18 (`4d8`) cold damage and are grappled (escape DC 21). On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't grappled. The difficult terrain disappears on initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Gegazol creates an opaque wall of black ice on a solid surface she can see within 120 feet of her. The wall is made up of twenty contiguous 10-foot square panels that are each 2 feet thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall the creature wants. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 60 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. The wall disappears when Gegazol uses this lair action again or when she dies.
