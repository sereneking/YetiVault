# Eldritch Claw Tattoo
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This tattoo depicts clawlike forms and other jagged shapes. While the tattoo is on your skin, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks, and you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with unarmed strikes.

## Eldritch Maul

As a bonus action, you can empower the tattoo for 1 minute. For the duration, each of your melee weapon attacks can reach a target up to 30 feet away from you, as tendrils of ink launch from your weapon or unarmed strike toward the target. In addition, your melee weapon attacks deal an extra `1d6` force damage on a hit. Once used, this bonus action can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Tattoo Attunement

To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you.
