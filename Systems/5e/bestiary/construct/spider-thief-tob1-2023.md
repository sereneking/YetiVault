# Spider Thief
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 342*  

*This clockwork spider creature is the size of a dog. Each of its eight sharp, sickle-like feet stabs or sinks slightly into the ground. Razor wire enwraps its body, while gyros whirl visibly in its faceless, clockwork head*.

## Wire Fighters

A spider thief never initiates combat unless ordered to, but it always defends itself against attack. Its initial attack is whirling its razor line to entangle a target. Once it snares a foe, the spider thief keeps attacking that foe until the victim stops resisting or the victim escapes from the spider's wire.

## Completely Loyal

This clockwork machine follows orders from its master even if they lead to its destruction, and it fights until destroyed or told to stand down. The machine recognizes only its creator as its master.

## Guild Tools

The spider thief got its name because of its ability to climb walls and to effortlessly cross gaps between buildings, making it an excellent accomplice for enterprising thieves. Some thieves' guilds make extensive use of them, and many freelance rogues use them as partners.
