**Cosmic Horror Adventure Sites**

`dice: [](cosmic-horror-adventure-sites-vrgr.md#^cosmic-horror-adventure-sites)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure Site |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A hidden floor of the royal library |
| 2 | The ninth basement beneath a family home that seems normal from the outside |
| 3 | A decrepit manor, empty save for staff who swear the lord is merely preoccupied |
| 4 | A small inn in the mountains that smells perpetually of brine |
| 5 | The place in the forest where all the animals come to die |
| 6 | A fortress manned by paladins, all of whom removed their own tongues |
| 7 | A sewage system that predates the city above |
| 8 | A thin chapel in the woods, whose bells rings without ceasing |
