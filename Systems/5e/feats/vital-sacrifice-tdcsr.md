# Vital Sacrifice
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 191*  

You've learned secrets of [hemocraft](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/hemocraft-tdcsr.md) that grant you esoteric power at the price of your own life force. As a bonus action, you can choose to take `1d6` necrotic damage to gain a blood boon. Your blood boon lasts for 1 hour or until expended.

You can expend this blood boon to gain one of the following benefits:

- When you make an attack roll, you roll `1d6` and add it to the total.  
- When you hit with an attack or spell, you deal an additional `2d6` necrotic damage.  
- When you cause a creature to make a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, roll a `d4` and reduce their save by the amount rolled.  

The damage you take to gain a blood boon can't be reduced in any way.
