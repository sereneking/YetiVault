**Unusual Locations**

`dice: [](unusual-locations-erlw.md#^unusual-locations)`

| dice: d6 | Location |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | A pool of glowing water sits in the middle of a ruined and abandoned village. Anyone who looks into the water sees brief reflections of the long-dead villagers going about their lives in harmony and joy. |
| 2 | In the middle of the wreckage of a carnival stands a perfectly preserved carousel. If the carousel is ridden, the characters doing so see visions of Cyre as it was before the Last War. |
| 3 | All the trees and plants in a forest have been turned to objects of glossy white stone with blood-red flecks. |
| 4 | The battlefield before the characters contains no bodies, only the clothing and weapons of thousands of missing soldiers. |
| 5 | The broken bodies of soldiers lie scattered across a battlefield, refusing to decompose. |
| 6 | The characters find a fallen warforged colossus (described later in this section). |
