# Aridni
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 25*  

*The gray, moth-winged fey flies out from the trees in a hail of tiny arrows.*

Both more rugged and more ruthless than normal pixies, the aridni are an especially greedy breed of fey bandits and kidnappers.

## Pale Archers

These ashen-faced fey with gray moth wings fire green-glowing arrows with a sneer and a curse. Aridni prefer ranged combat whenever possible, and they are quite difficult to lure into melee. They sometimes accept a personal challenge or respond to accusations of cowardice.

## Caravan Raiders

Aridni have developed different magical abilities that aid them well when they raid caravans for captives, such as charming foes or putting them to sleep.

## Wealth for Status

They delight in taking plunder from humans and dwarves as a sign of their power over mortals and of their contempt for those who lack fey blood.

> [!note] Aridni in Midgard
> 
> When the elves abandoned the mortal world and returned to the elflands, not all of their fey servants went with them. Some stayed by choice; some were abandoned as tainted, feral broods; and some remained to become servants of local gods or human mages. Most of them are angry at humans for their corruption of, and rebellions against, the elven courts and empires in Midgard. They seek to regain some of their fallen fey wealth and glory from humans and dwarves by stealing from, corrupting, and killing their ancient enemies. Among these abandoned fey are the aridni ("slaver pixies"), evil pixies suborned by the Slavers of Reth-Saal.
