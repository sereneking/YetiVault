## Traits

***Heated Body (Metal Only).*** A creature that touches the construct or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes `1d10` fire damage.

***Stony Lethargy (Stone Only).*** When a creature the construct can see starts its turn within 10 feet of the construct, the construct can force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target can't use reactions and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The construct makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell's level (rounded down).

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* the summoner's spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d8 + 4 + summonSpellLevel` bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

***Berserk Lashing (Clay Only).*** When the construct takes damage, it makes a slam attack against a random creature within 5 feet of it. If no creature is within reach, the construct moves up to half its speed toward an enemy it can see, without provoking opportunity attacks.
