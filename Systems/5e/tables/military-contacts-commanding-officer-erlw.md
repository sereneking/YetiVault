`dice: [](military-contacts-commanding-officer-erlw.md#^commanding-officer)`

| dice: d8 | Officer |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | An angry officer who yells every order, reprimands you for even the smallest mistake, and fully expects you to fail at every mission you undertake |
| 2 | A battle-scarred officer who experienced terrible horrors during the Last War and is barely capable of giving you orders through a haze of intoxication |
| 3 | A grim officer who expects the Last War to reignite at any moment and intends to be ready |
| 4 | A cheerful officer with a dark sense of humor who merrily sends you into grave danger |
| 5 | A kindly officer who is hesitant to send you into danger and constantly reminds you to be careful |
| 6 | A bitter officer who carries deep grudges against your nation's enemies in the Last War and leaps at any chance to deal them any blow |
| 7 | An optimistic officer who believes that a new era of peace is just over the horizon, as soon as these few last military tasks are complete |
| 8 | A devout officer who believes that your success or failure lies entirely in divine hands and you're ultimately just along for the ride |
