# Hazirawn
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, Hazirawn is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you are not attuned to Hazirawn, you deal an extra `1d6` necrotic damage when you hit with the weapon.

## Increased Potency

While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra `2d6` necrotic damage (instead of `1d6`).

## Spells

Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) (1 charge), [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) (1 charge), or [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains `1d4` expended charges.

## Wounding

While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success.
