# Borthak
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 212*  

Borthaks are irascible, wolflike behemoths that ravage northern wetlands and alpine fens on Krynn. Few mountain animals can challenge a borthak physically. Its powerful jaws, acidic spittle, and lightning-quick tail make the borthak an apex predator in its home territory.

Luckily for most wetland dwellers, borthaks rarely congregate. Unluckily, a single borthak can wreak havoc on an entire ecosystem with its supernatural ability to siphon heat from the ground. A borthak's body is so efficient at pulling the heat from its surroundings that it can transform a small, temperate glen into a frigid, slushy bog. Native plants and animals rarely survive long in a region a borthak claims as its hunting ground. Once a borthak has depleted an area of flora and fauna, it moves and begins its pillaging anew.

## Traits

***Glacial Aura.*** At the end of the borthak's turn, slippery ice covers surfaces within 10 feet of the borthak. This ice is difficult terrain. When a creature other than the borthak enters the ice's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or have the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. The ice disappears at the start of the borthak's next turn.

***Webbed Feet.*** The borthak can move across icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The borthak makes one Bite attack or uses Noxious Regurgitation if available, and it makes two Stomp attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d8 + 7`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) acid damage.

***Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`1d8 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.

***Noxious Regurgitation (Recharge 5-6).*** The borthak spews acid at a creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 24 (`7d6`) acid damage and has the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition until the start of the borthak's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## Reactions

***Reactive Tail.*** When a creature within 10 feet of the borthak hits the borthak with an attack roll, the borthak swings its tail in retaliation. The triggering creature and any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`2d8 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Move.*** The borthak moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Bite (Costs 2 Actions).*** The borthak makes one Bite attack.
