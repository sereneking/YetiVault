# Graz'zt

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Graz'zt can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Command.** Graz'zt casts the command spell on every creature of his choice in the lair. He needn't see each one, but he must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. He issues the same command to all the targets.  
- **Conjure Mirrors.** Smooth surfaces within the lair become as reflective as a polished mirror. Until a different lair action is used, creatures within the lair have disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Graz'zt's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Agitated Beasts.** Wild beasts within 6 miles of the lair break into frequent conflicts and coupling, mirroring the behavior that occurs during their mating seasons.  
- **Beguiling Realm.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks have advantage.  
- **Mirrors Everywhere.** Flat surfaces within 1 mile of the lair that are made of stone or metal become highly reflective, as though polished to a shine. These surfaces become supernaturally mirrorlike.  

If Graz'zt dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
