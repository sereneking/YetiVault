## Traits

***Reduced Threat.*** A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies), saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and saving throw DCs (included in the stat block).

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The golem's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The golem makes two slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Slow (Recharge 5-6).*** The golem targets one or more creatures it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn. In addition, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both. These effects last for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
