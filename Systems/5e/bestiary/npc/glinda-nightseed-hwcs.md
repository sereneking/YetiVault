# Glinda Nightseed
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

This huden gallus' plumage resembles a ptarmigan, and she usually wears a pince-nez on her beak. A professor of advanced theoretical necromancy, Glinda is known for having strange opinions about her field of study. Unlike most birdfolk, she sees necromancy as a manipulation of life energies on par with druidic magic. She is a kind soul, and only practices the lighter forms of necromancy. However, she has been performing secret experiments on the servitor skeletons in the Avium, hoping to develop a cutting-edge resurrection spell. This violates campus policies, which ban practical necromancy, and could cause her to lose her job. Glinda uses the gallus necromancer stat block. Her alignment is chaotic good.
