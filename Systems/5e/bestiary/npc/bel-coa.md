# Bel
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 234*  

From his bastion, Zariel's second-in-command and the former lord of Avernus oversees the forges that furnish weapons and armor for the Blood War. Though Asmodeus has instructed Zariel to accept Bel as her advisor, Bel and Zariel loathe each other and invent distractions to keep them apart.

Bel outwardly plays the role of Zariel's loyal vassal. However, Bel rankles at Zariel's rulership of the layer of the Nine Hells that was once his, but he won't challenge her directly as long as he thinks Asmodeus supports Zariel.

> [!note] Previous Adventures in Avernus: Bel

> If you have run Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus, then Bel might have replaced Zariel as the ruler of Avernus. If so, his lair is the Bronze Citadel instead of the Forge.

## Traits

***Fear Aura.*** Any creature hostile to Bel that starts its turn within 20 feet of him must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw unless Bel is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). If the save fails, the creature has the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition until the start of its next turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is immune to Bel's Fear Aura for the next 24 hours.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Bel fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Bel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Bel casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 24):

**At will**: [Detect Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [Fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md)

**1/day each**: [Imprisonment](/Systems/5e/spells/imprisonment.md), [Meteor Swarm](/Systems/5e/spells/meteor-swarm.md)

**2/day each**: [Dispel Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md), [Mirror Image](/Systems/5e/spells/mirror-image.md), [Mislead](/Systems/5e/spells/mislead.md), [Raise Dead](/Systems/5e/spells/raise-dead.md), [Teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md), [Wall of Fire](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Bel attacks twice with his Greatsword and once with his Tail.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (`4d6 + 9`) slashing damage plus 21 (`6d6`) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being held or worn, it catches fire.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (`3d10 + 9`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or have the [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition until the end of its next turn.

## Legendary Actions

***Fireball.*** Bel casts [Fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md).

***Tactical Edge (Costs 2 Actions).*** Roll a `d6` for Bel. The number rolled on the die is subtracted from the next attack roll made against Bel or an ally of his choice within the next minute.

***Summon Ice Devil (Costs 3 Actions).*** Bel magically summons an [ice devil](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) with an ice spear (as described in the ice devil's entry in the Monster Manual). The ice devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of Bel, acts as Bel's ally, and can summon other devils if it has such power. The ice devil remains until Bel dies or until he dismisses it with an action.
