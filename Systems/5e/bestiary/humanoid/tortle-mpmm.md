# Tortle
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 244, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 242*  

The generic tortle stat block here represents a warrior, especially the sort who travels far and wide.

## Tortles

Tortles are omnivorous, turtle-like bipeds with shells that cover most of their bodies. Because they carry their homes on their backs, tortles feel little need to stay put for long.

Most tortles like to see how other folk live. A tortle can spend decades away from their native land without feeling homesick, often viewing their current companions as their family.
