|----------|--------|
| 1 | Heliod decides to confront Erebos in the Underworld. He gathers fallen heroes around him as he marches on Erebos's palace in Tizerus. Meanwhile, the sun has vanished from the sky in the mortal world, and the dead can't enter the Underworld. |
| 2 | Heliod grows tired of the battles between Iroas and Mogis, and he decides to end their conflict by banishing Mogis. To his surprise, both gods turn against him. The resulting conflict causes the sun to rain divine blood, producing bizarre effects. |
| 3 | Angry at the hubris of nobles who boast of having the best hounds, Heliod turns all dogs into wolves and monsters that kill and run wild. |
| 4 | Heliod arms a champion with his weapon, Khrusor, but the hero goes wild with power and tries to slay Purphoros. The repercussions border on the cataclysmic, with the champion slain, Mount Velus erupting, and the spear shattered. Only Purphoros can repair the spear, and he's hardly in the mood to do so. |
