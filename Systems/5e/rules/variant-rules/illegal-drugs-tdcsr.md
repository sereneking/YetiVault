# Illegal Drugs
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 85* 

If you want to include drugs in your RPG campaign, consider discussing with your group in a "session zero" to make sure everyone is okay to encounter them in-game. If any player says no or doesn't enthusiastically buy-in, err on the side of caution and leave the drugs out. It's also important to check in with your group whenever drug use comes into play, just to make sure everyone is still having fun. Additionally, while use of drugs might be fine with everyone, also make sure you know how comfortable your players are with explicit descriptions of needles, issues of addiction, and any other topics related to drug use.

The "Clasp" and the "Myriad" deal in a variety of illegal, mind-altering drugs, and "Kymal" is the epicenter of both organizations' clientele. Though the creation and possession of these drugs is strictly prohibited in most of Tal'Dorei, they have found popularity within all levels of society, particularly in "Kymal", where the "Public Defense" frequently looks the other way for a small bribe.

## Oloore Root

This root is typically [sold in teabags](/Systems/5e/items/oloore-root-teabag-tdcsr.md) for 100 gp per dose. It was originally a ritualistic tool used by the followers of many gods, but now sees more recreational use. Oracles used it to enhance their divinations, for it helped them leave their physical bodies behind and become closer to gods and spirits. Drinking tea brewed from the root causes intense hallucinations, which feel like they have granted perfect clarity of mind to the imbiber.

After drinking [oloore tea](/Systems/5e/items/oloore-root-teabag-tdcsr.md) as an action, you must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or experience vivid hallucinations for `1d4` hours. During this time, you have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. If you fail the saving throw by 10 or more, your hallucinations become horrific visions and you gain a level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). On a success, you gain preternatural clarity, allowing you to cast the [scrying](/Systems/5e/spells/scrying.md) spell once within the next `1d4` hours.

## Zeal

Distilled from the ichor of demons, [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) was originally used by Tal'Dorei's ancient berserkers to grant them incredible strength and courage before battles. These days, it's most commonly used by criminal bruisers before a brawl. Most modern warriors stay well away from [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md), due both to its addictive nature and to the mental and physical degeneration it can cause over long periods of time. When prepared properly, [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) is a purple, ashy-tasting gel that typically costs 150 gp per dose.

After slathering [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) across your exposed skin as an action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for `1d4` rounds as your muscles lock up. On a success, your weapon attacks deal an additional `1d6` damage for the next minute. After this effect ends, you gain one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

## Suude

Exandria's most infamous drug, [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) is a glittering powder made from "residuum". It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the "Age of Arcanum" as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the "Calamity", and many different types of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.

After burning [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour and fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colorsâ€”yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md), or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.

On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md), and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) again.

[Brown suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-brown-tdcsr.md) allows you to use the [Extended Spell](/Systems/5e/optional-features/extended-spell.md) Metamagic option, [blue suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-blue-tdcsr.md) allows you to use [Twinned Spell](/Systems/5e/optional-features/twinned-spell.md), and [red suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-brown-tdcsr.md) grants [Distant Spell](/Systems/5e/optional-features/distant-spell.md).
