**Why Be a Loremonger?**

| dice: d8 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Your favorite thing to hear is, "I probably shouldn't say anything, but did you know... ?" |
| 2 | Your *whisper jar* is a better conversationalist than most people you've ever met. |
| 3 | You can't keep a secret for the life of you, and you need to tell someone this thing you know or it's going to kill you! |
| 4 | You never know when someone else's words will come in handy. |
| 5 | Peoples and cultures can never die as long as their stories are still told. |
| 6 | You talked about a really cool idea once when you were drunk, and can't remember a word of it now. That'll never happen again. |
| 7 | A person is only as good as their word, and you feel compelled to keep others honest. |
| 8 | You can't read or write, so this whole recording-and-playing-back-what-you-say-in-a-jar thing is a huge benefit. |
