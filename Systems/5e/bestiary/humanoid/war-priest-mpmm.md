# War Priest
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 254, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 218*  

War priests worship deities of war, protection, and strategy. They plan tactics, lead soldiers into battle, confront enemy spellcasters, and tend to casualties. A war priest might command an army or serve as the right hand of a [warlord](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/warlord-mpmm.md) (appears in "this book") on the battlefield.

War priests typically adorn themselves with a symbol of their faith. You can roll on the War Priest Holy Symbols table below, or choose one that fits your campaign.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The war priest makes two Maul attacks, and it uses Holy Fire.

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage  plus *Hit:* 10 (`3d6`) radiant damage.

***Holy Fire.*** The war priest targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 12 (`2d8 + 3`) radiant damage, and it is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of the war priest's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded).
