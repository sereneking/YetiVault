| dice: d10 | Debt |
|-----------|------|
| 1 | You committed a crime during the Last War, and now you're being blackmailed by someone who has proof. You can justify your actions, but the law won't care. |
| 2 | You've got a gambling problem. If you can't repay Daask (see "chapter 3"), you're going to be playing tag with a cockatrice. |
| 3 | You own an uncommon magic item, but you had to sell it to a pawn shop. If you can't reclaim it within the month, they'll sell it off. |
| 4 | You were making a delivery on behalf of the Boromar Clan (see "chapter 3") and you lost the merchandise. |
| 5 | Someone knows the whereabouts of a sibling or loved one you thought lost in the Mourning, but that information is going to cost you. |
| 6 | You have a degenerative disease that can't be cured by mundane means. If you can't get a lesser restoration soon, you're going to start showing symptoms. |
| 7 | Your family lost everything in the Last War. You could get them a stake in a new farm, inn, or stagecoach with 200 gp. |
| 8 | You've got a price on your head. Until you settle things with House Tharashk, you'd better keep an eye out for bounty hunters. |
| 9 | You have an opportunity to join an influential secret society. But you've got only one month to raise the membership dues. |
| 10 | Roll again. It's not your debt: it's your lover's problem. Can you solve the problem before they have to face the consequences? |
