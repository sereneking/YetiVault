`dice: [](creating-an-amethyst-dragon-amethyst-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^amethyst-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Balance. Everything is a complex interaction of forces that must be kept in a delicate and carefully maintained balance. (Neutral) |
| 2 | Knowledge. We are the whole of creation, seeking to understand itself. (Any) |
| 3 | Self-Improvement. I am a complex gem, and I constantly polish and refine my many facets to make the whole that much more perfect. (Any) |
| 4 | Responsibility. Having knowledge and power gives one a responsibility to those who have less of either. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Noble Obligation. My superior experience, intellect, and insight give me a duty to mediate disputes when I can. (Good) |
| 6 | Power. Knowledge is power, power must be used, and I use it. Your concerns are irrelevant. (Evil) |
