# Roachling Lord
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 310*  

*The creature is humanoid but disturbingly roachlike. Its legs are too short, its arms too long, and its back is covered by a carapace. Atop those features is an incongruously humanlike face*.

Combining the worst of human and cockroach qualities, these nimble creatures have a talent for stealth and for fighting dirty. Due to their natural resilience against disease, roachlings are comfortable with filth. "Good hygiene" is a foreign concept. This leaves most humanoids repulsed by the roachlings' smell.

## Clever Combatants

Though skittish and easily frightened, roachlings are practical, not cowards. They understand survival often depends on remaining unseen and out of reach, and they are adept at hit-and-run tactics.

## Cautious and Family-Oriented

Because most humanoids shun roachlings, they are naturally cautious around others, and they extend their trust to non-roachlings slowly. They live and associate with a tight-knit, extended family, which is led by a male or female roachling lord, and they put the needs of their community above all. A roachling away from or without a family often bonds with those it trusts most.

## Fused Carapace

Roachlings have prominent, whip-like antennae, a carapace covering much of their backs, and small spines on their legs and arms. They have short, noticeably bowed legs, and their hair is dark. Their thick, hardened skin appears shiny and slightly oily, although it is dr. Roachlings have an internal skeleton, however, not the exoskeleton of a true insect.
