# Suude (Brown)
*Illegal Drug, unknown (magic)*  


Exandria's most infamous drug, [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) is a glittering powder made from "residuum". It was first developed by power-hungry archmages in the "Age of Arcanum" as an incense burned to enhance focus during ritual spellcasting. The secret to its refinement has been lost and rediscovered a variety of times since the "Calamity", and many different types of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) have been developed by arcanists in search of ever-greater power. It has terrible addictive and mentally degenerative properties, even when used sparingly.

After burning [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) within a vessel and inhaling its fumes as an action, you take 22 (`4d10`) psychic damage and must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour and fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute, or until you are shaken awake as an action. During this time, the world seems to move in slow motion, and your vision is twisted in kaleidoscopic colorsâ€”yet your focus is never distorted. If one dose of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md), or more, is used within 1 hour of another, the DC of the Constitution saving throw is increased by 5 per additional dose. If you fail this save by 10 or more, you instantly drop to 0 hit points.

On a success, you gain the ability to use one of the following Metamagic options as a sorcerer for the next minute, requiring no sorcery points. The type of Metamagic you gain access to depends on the type of [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md), and once you use it, you can't use it again until you inhale [suude](/Systems/5e/items/suude-tdcsr.md) again.

Brown suude allows you to use the [Extended Spell](/Systems/5e/optional-features/extended-spell.md) Metamagic option.
