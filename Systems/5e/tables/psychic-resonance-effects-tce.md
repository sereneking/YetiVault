|------------|--------|
| 01–06 | One random creature in the region gains the ability to cast the [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell (save DC 13) once over the next 24 hours, requiring no components. Intelligence is the spellcasting ability for this spell. |
| 07–12 | One random creature in the region is affected by the [mind blank](/Systems/5e/spells/mind-blank.md) spell for the next 24 hours. |
| 13–18 | For 1 minute on initiative count 20 (losing all ties), Tiny and Small objects in the region that aren't being worn or carried are flung by an unseen force. One random creature in the region must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `2d4` bludgeoning damage from the flung objects. |
| 19–24 | Memories become sharp and clear for 1 hour. During this time, each creature in the region adds double its proficiency bonus to Intelligence checks made to recall information. |

Once within the next minute, the creature can use a bonus action to magically assault the mind of another creature it can see. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or take `4d10` psychic damage. |
