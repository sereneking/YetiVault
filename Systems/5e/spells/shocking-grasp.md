# Shocking Grasp
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes `1d8` lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 5th level (`2d8`), 11th level (`3d8`), and 17th level (`4d8`).

**Classes**: [Artificer](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
