# Blood of the Lycanthrope
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  


This poison is created from blood harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) lycanthrope in its animal or hybrid form. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy (see the Monster Manual). The curse lasts until removed by the [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic.

The type of lycanthropy depends on the lycanthrope used to create the poison. To determine the type of lycanthropy randomly, roll a `d6`:

`dice: [](blood-of-the-lycanthrope-imr.md#^lycanthropy)`
