# Travel at Sea
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 199* 

It's not just pirates and sea monsters that make journeys on the sea so treacherous. Foul weather, nautical accidents, infested food, illness, and worse all conspire to send even the most capable crews to watery graves. The following rules help adjudicate travel at sea, specifically voyages of an hour or more. This material builds on the travel rules in the "Player's Handbook" and the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Travel Pace

Ships travel at a speed given in their stat blocks. Unlike with land travel, ships can't choose to move at a faster pace, though they can choose to go slower.

If a ship's mode of movement takes damage, it might be slowed. For every decrease of 10 feet in speed, reduce the ship's travel pace by 1 mile per hour and 24 miles per day.

## Activity While Traveling

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/variantrules/GoS/095-za-05-travel-at-sea-p199.webp#center)

The activities available to a ship's crew and passengers are a bit different from the options available to a group traveling by land. Refer to ""Activity While Traveling"" in chapter 8 of the "Player's Handbook" for more information on some of the topics discussed below.

A number of activities are restricted to certain officers, unless the DM rules otherwise. For example, a DM might allow a bard to engage in the Raise Morale activity by playing bawdy songs on deck to lift the crew's spirits.

The party's pace has no effect on the activities they can engage in while traveling by ship.

### Draw a Map

A ship's captain often undertakes this activity, producing a map of the ship's progress and helps the crew get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

### Forage

The character casts fishing lines, keeping an eye out for sources of food, making a Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check when the DM calls for it.

### Raise Morale (First Mate Only)

The first mate can manage the crew's time to grant extended breaks, provide instruction, and generally improve the quality of life on the ship. Once every 24 hours, if the crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the first mate can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a successful check, the crew's quality score increases by 1.

### Navigate (Quartermaster Only)

The quartermaster can try to prevent the ship from becoming lost, making a Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check when the DM calls for it. (See ""Becoming Lost"" in chapter 5 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more information.)

### Noticing Threats

Use the passive Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of the player characters or the crew to determine whether anyone on the ship notices a hidden threat. The crew has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score equal to 10 + the crew's quality score. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a specific area of the ship. For example, only characters below deck might have a chance to hear or spot a creature hiding on board.

### Repair (Bosun Only)

At the end of the day, the ship's bosun can make a Strength check using [carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md). On a 15 or higher, each damaged component regains hit points equal to `1d6` + the crew's quality score (minimum of 1 hit point). A component other than the hull that had 0 hit points becomes functional again.

### Stealth (Captain Only)

The ship's captain can engage in this activity only if the weather conditions restrict visibility, such as in heavy fog. The ship makes a Dexterity check with a bonus equal to the crew's quality score to determine if it can hide.

## Hazards

Sea travel is an innately dangerous proposition. A storm on land might bog down a caravan, delaying its trip by a few days, while at sea a storm can split a ship in two and send everyone aboard to their doom. The close quarters of life aboard a ship leads to short tempers and brawls, while a few rats that sneak aboard can spread disease and spoil supplies. This section presents a variety of common hazards sailors might face on the sea.

### Group Checks

To determine how a ship fares against these hazards, each threat requires the ship's officers and crew to make a special group check (see "chapter 7" of the "Player's Handbook" for how group checks work). The description of a hazard specifies which officers can roll to contribute to the group check. That description also states what ability check an officer makes. Even if the officers make different ability checks, their successes and failures contribute to the one group check.

Additionally, all the non-officer members of the crew make a single check, a `d20` roll modified by the crew's quality. The success or failure of all these checks—both the officers and the crew—determines the result of the group check.

While each hazard lists the officers assigned to participate in a group check, anyone can attempt an officer's check in a pinch, with two exceptions: First, only the captain can make checks associated with the captain's role; no one else can take the captain's place. Second, only one character can attempt an officer's check; they can't receive help.

Once all the checks related to the group check have been rolled, the ship's success or failure is determined. Hazards offer four levels of success or failure determined by the results of the ship's group check. A total success or a total failure occurs when every roll in the group check is a success or a failure, respectively.

### Determining Hazards

Traveling by sea is an innately dangerous proposition. When running an ocean adventure, you can select hazards based on the needs of your campaign or generate them randomly.

To determine hazards at random, roll a `d20` at the start of each day of an ocean voyage. On a 20, the ship faces a hazard that day. Use the following two tables to determine the nature of the hazard and the DC of the threat it presents. Specifics corresponding to each of these DC levels are detailed along with each of the following hazards.

**Hazard Type**

`dice: [](travel-at-sea-gos.md#^hazard-type)`

| dice: d20 | Hazard Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1–3 | Crew conflict |
| 4–6 | Fire |
| 7–9 | Fog |
| 10–12 | Infestation |
| 13–20 | Storm |
^hazard-type

**Hazard DC**

`dice: [](travel-at-sea-gos.md#^hazard-dc)`

| dice: d20 | Hazard DC |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–9 | 10 |
| 10–17 | 15 |
| 18–19 | 20 |
| 20 | 25 |
^hazard-dc

### Crew Conflict

Sailors can be a rough-and-tumble bunch, and cramming them into a ship's confined quarters leads to inevitable rivalries, feuds, and petty crimes. If resentments among the crew grow too strong, the officers must step in and set things right, lest they risk mutiny or worse.

Each day a ship spends dealing with a crew conflict requires those aboard to make a group check. The check's DC is randomly determined or chosen from the Crew Conflicts DCs table. The captain, first mate, and cook each make an ability check, as shown on the Crew Conflict Checks table. This check takes the place of any other activities that the officer might undertake that day, representing their contribution to placating the crew. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check.

Even though the crew is causing trouble, some members help the officers, and thus the crew still contributes a roll to the group check. Roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Crew Conflict Check Results table.

**Crew Conflict DCs**

| DC | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 10 | Minor scuffle or petty theft |
| 15 | Brawl involving several people, theft of a valuable |
| 20 | Large brawl resulting in several injuries, theft of a prized item |
| 25 | Murder, serious brawl involving most of the crew |

| Success | The hazard ends. |
| Failure | The crew's quality score decreases by 1. |
| Total Failure | The crew's quality score decreases by 1, and the crew immediately mutinies. |
^crew-conflict-check-results

### Fire

A fire at sea can turn a ship into a burned-out hulk, its crew slain or forced overboard.

If a fire erupts aboard a ship, its officers and crew must make a group check to coordinate efforts to extinguish it. The check's DC is randomly determined or chosen from the Fire DCs table. The group check represents 5 minutes of work. The captain, first mate, bosun, and surgeon each make an ability check, as shown on the Fire Checks table. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check. Also, roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Fire Check Results table.

**Fire DCs**

| DC | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 10 | Small, contained fire, equivalent to an oil lantern |
| 15 | Dangerous flame, equivalent to a large campfire, or multiple, smaller fires ignited at once |
| 20 | Intense fire with significant chance to spread, equivalent to a bonfire |
| 25 | Sudden, pervasive flames, such as from igniting a hold filled with flammable cargo |
^fire-dcs

**Fire Checks**

| Officer | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Captain | Intelligence (water vehicles) |
| First mate | Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) |
| Bosun | Strength ([carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md)) |
| Surgeon | Intelligence ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) |
^fire-checks

**Fire Check Results**

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Total Success | The fire is extinguished with nothing beyond cosmetic damage. |
| Success | The fire is extinguished, but the hull and `1d3` other random components take `6d6` fire damage. |
| Failure | The hull and `1d3` other random components take `6d6` fire damage, and the fire continues. Make another set of checks. |
| Total Failure | The crew's quality score decreases by 1 due to injuries, while the hull and `1d3` other random components take `6d6` fire damage. The fire continues. Make another set of checks. |
^fire-check-results

### Fog

Fog on land is usually an inconvenience, but at sea it can prove disastrous. Decreased visibility makes navigation more difficult and can cause a vessel to crash.

A group check determines how the officers and crew manage through one day of fog. The check's DC is randomly determined or chosen from the Fog DCs table. The captain and quartermaster each make an ability check, as shown on the Fog Checks table. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check. Also, roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Fog Check Results table.

**Fog DCs**

| DC | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 10 | Light fog |
| 15 | Moderate fog |
| 20 | Heavy fog |
| 25 | Very heavy fog |
^fog-dcs

**Fog Checks**

| Officer | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Captain | Intelligence (water vehicles) |
| Quartermaster | Wisdom ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) |
^fog-checks

**Fog Check Results**

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Total Success | The fog has no effect on navigation, and the crew's quality increases by 1 for `1d3` days. |
| Success | The fog has no effect on navigation. |
| Failure | The fog slows the ship, reducing its travel pace and speed by half for the day. |
| Total Failure | The fog slows the ship and disorients the crew, reducing the vessel's travel pace and speed by half for the day and causing it to move in a random direction. |
^fog-check-results

### Infestation

Provisioning a sea journey is challenging, particularly when allocating what to pack for the voyage. A rat infestation or an outbreak of even a minor illness can spell disaster at sea. This type of hazard covers illnesses, infestations, spoiled supplies, and other troubles that wear away a crew's health.

Each day a ship spends dealing with an infestation requires those aboard to make a group check. The check's DC is randomly determined or chosen from the Infestation DCs table. The captain, first mate, surgeon, and cook each make an ability check, as shown on the Infestation Checks table. This check takes the place of any other activities that the officer might undertake that day. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check. Also, roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Infestation Check Results table.

**Infestation DCs**

| DC | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 10 | Minor bug or rat infestation, common cold |
| 15 | Persistent bug or rat infestation, stomach ailment or typical flu |
| 20 | Serious bug or rat infestation, contagious flu or spoiled food |
| 25 | Overwhelming bug or rat infestation, lethal plague |
^infestation-dcs

**Infestation Checks**

| Officer | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Captain | Intelligence (water vehicles) |
| First mate | Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) |
| Surgeon | Intelligence ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) |
| Cook | Constitution ([cook's utensils](/Systems/5e/items/cooks-utensils.md)) |
^infestation-checks

**Infestation Check Results**

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Total Success | The crew's quality score increases by 1 for `1d4` days, and the hazard ends. |
| Success | The hazard ends. |
| Failure | The crew's quality score decreases by 1. |
| Total Failure | The crew's quality score decreases by 1, and the distraction caused by the crisis forces the ship to move at half speed that day. |
^infestation-check-results

### Storm

Winds and towering waves toss ships like bath toys. Snowstorms batter vessels venturing too far north. Hurricanes consume whole armadas. More common and deadlier than most sea monsters, storms claim more ships than any other threat on the high seas.

Each day a ship spends involved in a storm requires those aboard to make a group check. The check's DC is randomly determined or chosen from the Storm DCs table. The captain, first mate, bosun, and quartermaster each make an ability check, as shown on the Storm Checks table. This check takes the place of any other activities that the officer might undertake that day, representing their contribution to keeping the ship afloat. If no one makes the check for a particular officer, a failure is contributed toward the group check. Also, roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll, and compare that check to the DC.

Determine how many of the group's checks succeeded—the officers' and the crew's—then consult the Storm Check Results table.

**Storm DCs**

| DC | Description |
|----|-------------|
| 10 | Heavy gale |
| 15 | Strong storm |
| 20 | Typical hurricane |
| 25 | Overwhelming hurricane |
^storm-dcs

**Storm Checks**

| Officer | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Captain | Intelligence (water vehicles) |
| First mate | Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) |
| Bosun | Strength ([carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md)) |
| Quartermaster | Wisdom ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) |
^storm-checks

**Storm Check Results**

| Result | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Total Success | The ship survives unscathed. The crew's quality score increases by 1 for `1d4` days. |
| Success | The ship survives unscathed. |
| Failure | The ship's components each take `4d10` bludgeoning damage. The crew's quality score decreases by 1. The ship struggles, moving at half speed that day. |
| Total Failure | The ship's components each take `10d10` bludgeoning damage. The crew's quality score decreases by 2, and 10 percent of the crew is washed overboard and lost. The ship is blown off course and struggles to recover its bearings, moving in a random direction. |
