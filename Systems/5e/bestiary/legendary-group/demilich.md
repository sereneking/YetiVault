# Demilich

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the demilich rolls a `d20`. On a result of 11 or higher, the demilich takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. It can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- The tomb trembles violently for a moment. Each creature on the floor of the tomb must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- The demilich targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. An [antimagic field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md) fills the space of the target, moving with it until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- The demilich targets any number of creatures it can see within 30 feet of it. No target can regain hit points until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

A demilich's tomb might have any or all of the following effects in place:

- The first time a non-evil creature enters the tomb's area, the creature takes 16 (`3d10`) necrotic damage.  
- Monsters in the tomb have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and against features that turn undead.  
- The tomb is warded against the magical travel of creatures the demilich hasn't authorized. Such creatures can't teleport into or out of the tomb's area or use planar travel to enter or leave it. Effects that allow teleportation or planar travel work within the tomb as long as they aren't used to leave or enter the tomb's area.  

If the demilich is destroyed, these effects fade over the course of 10 days.
