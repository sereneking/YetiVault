# Druidic Warrior
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 7*  

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. They count as druid spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the druid spell list.
