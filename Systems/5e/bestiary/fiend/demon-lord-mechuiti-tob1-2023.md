# Demon Lord Mechuiti
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 78*  

*A yellow-green fire burns atop the head of this towering, redfurred demon, which resembles an enormous mandrill. It has massive, muscular arms tipped with razor-sharp claws, a slavering jaw filled with huge fangs, and tusks that curl back almost to its blue cheeks.*

Towering around 25 feet tall, Mechuiti, Lord of Cannibal Apes, can stand erect like a human or walk on his knuckles, like a great ape.

## Bloodskull Island

After being expelled from the sweltering jungles and deadly swamps of the Hell of Cannibals, Mechuiti was coughed out of a volcanic portal onto an island now called Bloodskull. Here, he schemes and plots his revenge while breeding demonic minions.

## Corruptor of the Behtu

When Mechuiti first arrived on the Material Plane, he enthralled a group of jungle-dwelling simians, known as the behtu, by visiting their leaders and priests in dreams and nightmares. After convincing these leaders to come to his volcanic home, he infected them with his demonic ichor, transforming them in mind and body, and taught them tattoo magic to give them fiendish power and strength. They returned to their people with this new power and knowledge of the ritual for transforming the rest of their people.

## Bound But Dangerous

Only with the most powerful magic and technology did the ancient people bind him within Bloodskull Island's volcanoâ€”the best they could accomplish, since they couldn't destroy him. Despite imprisonment, Mechuiti has remained a terror through the ages. The behtu have not found the key to their master's release, but they still torture and ensorcel unlucky explorers who stumble into their abode, hoping to find someone who can unlock their master's prison.

## Commander of Monsters

Mechuiti commands the behtu to breed fiendish beasts and lizards with his blood: dire apes, fiery giant lizards, and even demonic spiders. He has raised generations of flame dragons, which lair in the volcano's caldera, to guard his temple-fane and deal with threats beyond the behtus' reach.

## Mechuiti's Lair

Mechuiti is trapped within the volcano in his island prison. However, imprisonment hasn't prevented Mechuiti from mustering an army and turning his confinement into a nightmarish bastion.

## Traits

***Demon Lord's Ichor.*** When Mechuiti is subjected to piercing damage or slashing damage, a spray of caustic blood spurts from his hide. Each creature within 10 feet of Mechuiti must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or becoming infected with the Mechuiti's deadly ichor disease and be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 14 (`4d6`) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. The disease can be cured by the [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic or when the creature succeeds on three saving throws.

***Fiery Weapons.*** Mechuiti's weapon attacks are magical. When Mechuiti hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `6d6` fire damage (included in the attack).

***Immolating Corona.*** At the start of each of Mechuiti's turns, each creature within 10 feet of him takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or catch fire. A creature that touches Mechuiti or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or catch fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the creature on fire takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Mechuiti fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Mechuiti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Speak with Simians.*** Mechuiti can communicate with apes and monkeys as if they shared a language.

***Spellcasting.*** Mechuiti casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

**At will**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [hold monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md), [wall of fire](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

**3/day each**: [fire storm](/Systems/5e/spells/fire-storm.md), [power word stun](/Systems/5e/spells/power-word-stun.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Mechuiti can use his Frightful Presence. He then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (`4d10 + 9`) piercing damage plus 21 (`6d6`) fire damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (`4d8 + 9`) slashing damage plus 21 (`6d6`) fire damage. If Mechuiti scores a critical hit, he rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Mechuiti's choice that is within 120 feet of Mechuiti and aware of him must succeed on a DC 24 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Mechuiti's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Burning Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Mechuiti exhales fire and acid in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 49 (`14d6`) fire damage and 49 (`14d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

***Move.*** Mechuiti moves up to his speed, or he climbs up to half his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Burn from the Inside.*** Mechuiti chooses a creature within 120 feet of him that is infected with the Mechuiti's deadly ichor disease. The target must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage and 10 (`3d6`) acid damage and catches fire. On a success, the target takes half the damage and doesn't catch fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the target takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Mechuiti uses Spellcasting.
