# Inspired
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 294*  

The rulers of distant Sarlona are known as the Inspired. These noble families are said to be bound to celestial spirits that guide and empower them, but the truth is far darker. The Inspired are the mortal hosts of the nightmare spirits of Dal Quor, and they carry out the foul agenda of the Dreaming Dark.

Any humanoid who can dream can volunteer to serve as a quori vessel. But the Inspired of Sarlona are humans bred to be such vessels. They have no choice in this destiny, since they can't resist quori possession. Physically, Inspired resemble the kalashtar, possessing an almost supernatural beauty.

Most of the people of the Five Nations have heard of the Inspired lords in Riedraâ€”never realizing that Inspired are spread throughout Khorvaire as well. Beggars and generals, mayors and merchants might all be secret servants of the Dreaming Dark. Such Inspired have to willingly accept quori possession, but the Dreaming Dark has long experience in weaving dreams that can convince mortals to surrender their bodies.
