# Hooked Shortspear
*Melee Weapon, unknown*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Properties**: [Light](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Light), Martial
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.
