On the world of Eberron, many strange, magic-warped monsters have emerged from the depths of the war-wracked Mournland. The blazebear is one such monster, so named for its hulking, ursine figure and the glow of its eyes. This glow is magical energy that saturates the blazebear's entire body. Swipes from a blazebear's claws dole out painful wounds and can end spells, and its gaze can stun prey.
