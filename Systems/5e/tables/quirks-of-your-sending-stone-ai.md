| dice: d8 | Quirk |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | It's a flip stone. |
| 2 | It gets great reception everywhere except in your headquarters. |
| 3 | It sometimes picks up other magical conversations. |
| 4 | It's the perfect size, shape, and weight to be used as a skipping stone. |
| 5 | It heats up when you use it, to the extent that it once burned through your gloves. |
| 6 | It has an obnoxious ringtone that you can't work out how to change. |
| 7 | It fails to notify you of incoming messages except for a faint pulsating glow. |
| 8 | It's voice activated, so that every time you talk to someone, it tries to send a message to someone else. |
