# Knife of Stolen Resistance
*Melee Weapon, rare*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 P
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

Using an action, you carve a single infernal rune into the flesh of an [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) Beast, Celestial, Dragon, Fey, or Giant with this knife. Over the next 10 minutes the creature dies an agonizing death that can't be prevented short of the [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell. If the creature has any resistances or immunities, you gain those resistances and immunities until the creature dies or a [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell is used to save the creature. The knife's power can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
