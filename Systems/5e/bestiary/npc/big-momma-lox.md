## Traits

***Unusual Nature.*** Big Momma doesn't require air.

## Actions

***Swallowing Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 45 (`6d12 + 6`) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by Big Momma. Big Momma can have one creature swallowed at a time.

A swallowed creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Big Momma, and takes 11 (`2d10`) acid damage at the start of each of Big Momma's turns from the digestive juices in Big Momma's gullet.

If Big Momma takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Big Momma must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of Big Momma. If Big Momma dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Bonus Actions

***Ray of Fear (Recharge 4-6).*** Big Momma's eye emits an [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible), magical ray that targets one creature Big Momma can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of Big Momma until the start of Big Momma's next turn.
