**Lingering Nightmares**

`dice: [](nightmare-magic-lingering-nightmares-ai.md#^lingering-nightmares)`

| dice: d6 | Nightmare |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | You stand atop a cliff as an apocalyptic sea monster emerges and begins painting the world around you with a brush in each tentacle. You cannot escape its attention, but wake up just before you are recolored. |
| 2 | You dream about walking on pieces of paper, each of which is scribed with the word "eggshells." This is written in multiple languages, some of which you can't read. |
| 3 | You are giving the most important presentation of your career, and the magic you are using to create an impressive visual display has gone haywire. It now displays an illusory image of you wearing nothing but a strategically placed scarf. |
| 4 | A franchise staff member has gained a huge inheritance and retired. A note signed by you indicates that you withdrew the same huge amount of cash from company accounts the day before, but you have no memory of doing so. |
| 5 | You feel the pleasant tickling of feathers, then look up to find a cockatrice preening on your chest. |
| 6 | All your pockets have been torn open, but you can't stop placing valuable objects in them. Each time an object falls out of a pocket, you pick it up, then put it in a pocket again. |
