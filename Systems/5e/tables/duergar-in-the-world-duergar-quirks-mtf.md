|----------|-------|
| 1 | A separate personality in your mind provides advice and guidance to you. |
| 2 | Your gear must be perfectly arranged, otherwise someone must bleed. |
| 3 | When there isn't a roof over your head, you keep your eyes on the ground. |
| 4 | You don't talk unless you absolutely must. |
| 5 | The outside world is a giant cave, and nothing will convince you otherwise. |
| 6 | Humans fascinate you, and you collect odd trinkets of their culture. |
