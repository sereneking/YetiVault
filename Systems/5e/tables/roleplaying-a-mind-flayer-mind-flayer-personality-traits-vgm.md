`dice: [](roleplaying-a-mind-flayer-mind-flayer-personality-traits-vgm.md#^mind-flayer-personality-traits)`

| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I never let pass an opportunity to show my contempt for lesser beings. |
| 2 | I like to flavor my meals by engendering positive emotions in my victims before feeding on them. |
| 3 | So as not to taint my thoughts, I avoid telepathically communicating with lesser beings when possible. |
| 4 | I never eat unless the victim is conscious and aware. |
| 5 | I'm very picky. I feed only on the brains of a specific kind of humanoid. |
| 6 | I'm curious about how other races live and how their societies function. |
| 7 | I find battle stimulating. |
| 8 | I'm curious about the limits of other creatures' intelligence and devise situations to test them. |
