**Mountain Encounters**

`dice: [](mountain-encounters-llk.md#^mountain-encounters)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1–2 | A party of monks (five [Cultists](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) led by a [Cult Fanatic](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md)) either survived the characters' assault on the Monastery of the Distressed Body or were away from the monastery and returned to find it routed. They pursue the characters—to try to convince them to take on leadership of the monastery. |
| 3 | A party of surviving monks (five [Cultists](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md)) pursues the characters in revenge, led by an escaped [Brain in a jar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/brain-in-a-jar-llk.md) using cobbled-together mechanical gear for mobility. (If the Grand Master was defeated and its brain survived any encounter in the treasury (area M10), that brain now leads this group.) |
| 4 | The characters discover signs of past expeditions to the Barrier Peaks—the remains of travelers crushed by fallen rocks. If searched, the bodies might still possess useful gear or fragmentary maps showing the layout of Daoine Gloine. But a close inspection shows that some bodies have had part of their flesh melted away (from encounters with wandering ooze-folk). |
| 5 | A [Galeb Duhr](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md) (sibling to the one in the monastery tunnels) blocks a key route into the lost city of Daoine Gloine. A character must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check for the party to pass. But these galeb duhr have an instinctive knowledge of each other, granting advantage or disadvantage on the check depending on how the other galeb duhr was treated. If the other galeb duhr was killed, this one attacks as soon as the characters are recognized. |
| 6–7 | A wandering [Ooze-Folk](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/ooze-folk-llk.md) appears, having accidentally trekked out of the city. |
| 8–10 | An isolated village clings to the mountainside, populated by [Kenku](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kenku.md) descended from Daoine Gloine refugees who fled the city when it was flooded with ooze. The kenku still remember ancient legends their forebears told about a cult of the medusa, as well as Kwalish's arrival and the "plague of ooze." However, their ability to speak only in mimicry might make it challenging for the characters to communicate with them. In the course of the conversation, the kenku might mimic the sounds of destruction and screaming heard as the city was overwhelmed, relay the mad ranting of the medusa, and so forth. They might even repeat the words of Kwalish himself as he talks of his extradimensional experiments with glass baubles, and his efforts to hide his lab inside of one. |
