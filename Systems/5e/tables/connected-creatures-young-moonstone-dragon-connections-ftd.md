| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) on the cusp of adulthood refuses to settle down and build a lair. To protect the local populace from the dragon's chaotic activities, a minor deity sends a [deva](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) to temper the dragon's mischievous spirit. |
| 2 | A [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) fell victim to a [fomorian's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/fomorian.md) curse and has elected to stay with the Giant rather than reveal this magical affliction. |
| 3 | A [treant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/treant.md) and a [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) love to meet and share stories. While the dragon speaks of travels and adventures, the treant tells tales of the tiny moments that make up a forest's life. |
| 4 | A [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) has acquired a powerful magic item belonging to one of the fey courts and is leading the assassin sent to retrieve the item on a chase through the Feywild. |
| 5 | A [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) has joined a pack of [blink dogs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) for a year and a day. The dragon pretends to be a blink dog and refuses to admit otherwise until this time with the pack expires. |
| 6 | A [young moonstone dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-moonstone-dragon-ftd.md) and a [night hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md) repeatedly encounter each other in the dream realm, but they have never met in the flesh. |
