# Grasping Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter p. 2*  

When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, thorny brambles that wrap around the target. The target hit by the arrow takes a -10 penalty to speed, and it takes `2d6` slashing damage if it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can touch it can use its action to try to remove the brambles, which requires a successful DC 10 Strength check. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute.
