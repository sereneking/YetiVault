# Fighting Initiate
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 2*  

**Prerequisite**: Proficiency with a martial weapon

Your martial training has helped you develop a particular style of fighting. As a result, you learn one [Fighting Style](/Systems/5e/optional-features/list-fighting-style-fighter.md) option of your choice from the fighter class. If you already have a style, the one you choose must be different.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace this feat's fighting style with another one from the fighter class that you don't have.
