## Description

Merfolk who followed Emeria's creed seek wisdom and truth in the Wind Realm, exploring the mystical forces—rather than natural causes—behind historical events. They are evasive and intentionally enigmatic in their interactions with others, and are often described as manipulative and deceptive.

Curious, thoughtful, and analytical, the merfolk of Zendikar are natural scholars and explorers. In the past, merfolk society was organized around their belief in three deities. But in the wake of the reappearance of the Eldrazi, the merfolk have realized that their faith was a web of lies, built on a corrupted memory of the Eldrazi titans handed down from generation to generation. In peaceful times, the merfolk might have fought over the ultimate meaning of this revelation. But faced with the danger presented by the Eldrazi broods, the merfolk have largely set aside their differences and joined together in a united force. Old grudges still linger, but the well-being of the merfolk race—and the world—far outweigh any ancient conflicts between creeds.

Merfolk are associated with blue mana, though the traditional merfolk creeds express this connection in different ways.

### Born of the Sea

Merfolk are an amphibious race, born and at home in the water but comfortable on dry land. Humanoid in form, they have skin of ivory, silver, russet, blue, or deep purple. Long fins extend from the backs of their forearms and calves, and their fingers and toes are webbed. The hairlike growths on their heads are either thick and bristly like the needles of a sea urchin, or long and wavy, resembling fine seaweed. In either case, these growths typically range in color from red to warm brown to black. Male merfolk have similar growths extending down from their cheekbones.

Merfolk wear little clothing unless they are armored for battle. Even then, they drape themselves with nets and a minimum of cloth, wearing armor crafted of large, bleached seashells and augmented with leather.
