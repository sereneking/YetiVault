|----------|-------|
| 1 | I often lose track of whether I'm in the Feywild or on the Material Plane. |
| 2 | I have been known to throw caution to the wind when in pursuit of new items for my hoard. |
| 3 | No matter how old I get, I always delight in harmless pranks and tricks. |
| 4 | I've always been mature for my age, and I can't wait for the day I can retire to my lair to be taken care of by doting fey. |
| 5 | I look down upon any being who resorts to violence to solve a problem. |
| 6 | Conversing with others is often difficult because I'm so easily distr... oh my goodness, is that circlet made of silver? |
| 7 | I find the waking world tedious and mundane and would much rather spend my time asleep, in the realm of dreams. |
| 8 | I find the whimsy of fey, and whimsy in general, to be exasperating and exhausting. |
