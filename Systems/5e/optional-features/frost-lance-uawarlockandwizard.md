# Frost Lance
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Archfey" Patron, [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md) cantrip

You draw on the gifts of the Prince of Frost to trap your enemies in ice. When you hit a creature with your [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md) cantrip one or more times on your turn, you can reduce that creature's speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.
