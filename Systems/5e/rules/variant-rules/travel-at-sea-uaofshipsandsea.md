# Travel at Sea
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 6* 

Here are rules to help adjudicate travel at sea, specifically travel of an hour or more. This material builds on the travel rules in the "Player's Handbook" and the "Dungeon Master's Guide".

## Travel Pace

Ships travel at a speed given their stat blocks. Unlike with land travel, players can't choose to move at a faster pace, though they can choose to go slower.

If a ship's mode of movement takes damage, it might be slowed. For every decrease of 10 feet in speed, reduce the ship's pace by 1 mile per hour and 24 miles per day.

## Activity While Traveling

The activities available to a ship's crew and passengers are a bit different from the options available to a group traveling by land. Refer to ""Activity While Traveling"" in chapter 8 of the "Player's Handbook" for more information on some of the topics discussed below.

A number of activities are restricted to certain officers, unless the DM rules otherwise. For example, a bard might be allowed to engage in the raise morale activity by playing bawdy songs on deck to lift the crew's spirits.

The party's pace has no effect on the activities they can engage in while traveling by ship.

### Draw a Map

A ship's captain often undertakes this activity, producing a map that records the ship's progress and helps the crew get back on course if they get lost. No ability check is required.

### Forage

The character casts out fishing lines, keeping an eye out for sources of food, making a Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check when the DM calls for it.

### Raise Morale (First Mate Only)

The first mate can manage the crew's time to grant extended breaks, provide instruction, and improve morale. Once per day, if the crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the first mate can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. On a successful check, the crew's quality score increases by 1.

### Navigate (Quartermaster Only)

The quartermaster can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) check when the DM calls for it. (See ""Becoming Lost"" in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.)

### Noticing Threats

Use the passive Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score of the characters or the crew to determine whether anyone on the ship notices a hidden threat. The crew has a passive Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) score equal to 10 + the crew's quality score. The DM might decide that a threat can be noticed only by characters in a specific area of the ship. For example, only characters below deck might have a chance to hear or spot a creature hiding on board.

### Repair (Bosun Only)

The ship's bosun can undertake this activity. At the end of the day, the bosun can make a Strength check using [carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md). On a 15 or higher, each damaged component regains hit points equal to `1d6` + the crew's quality score (minimum of 1 hit point). A component other than the hull that had 0 hit points becomes functional again.

### Stealth (Captain Only)

The ship's captain can engage in this activity only if the weather conditions restrict visibility, such as in heavy fog. The ship makes a Dexterity check with a bonus equal to the crew's quality score to determine if it can hide.

## Hazards

Hazards come in two basic types: environmental hazards, such as storms or turbulent waters, and other events, such as a fire aboard the ship or a plague outbreak.

### Environmental Hazards

Icebergs choke a misty sea. Winds and towering waves threaten to capsize a ship. Snowstorms batter ships that venture north too late in the year. These are all examples of environmental hazards that can last for days and demand a crew's attention.

Each day a ship spends involved in a hazard requires the officers to each make a special ability check, as shown on the Hazard Checks table. This check takes the place of any other activities that the officer might undertake and represents the officer's contribution to keeping the ship afloat.

**Hazard Checks**

| Officer | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Captain | Intelligence (water vehicles) |
| First mate | mate Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) |
| Bosun | Strength ([carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md)) |
| Quartermaster | Wisdom ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) |
| Surgeon | Intelligence ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) |
| Cook | Constitution ([cook's utensils](/Systems/5e/items/cooks-utensils.md)) |
^hazard-checks

If there is no one available to make a check, treat the result as a 0.

Finally, roll a `d20` for the crew, using its quality score as a modifier to the roll. Add up all of these checks and then refer to the Hazard Check Results table. That table shows if the ship has met with disaster or success in surviving that day of the hazard.

**Hazard Check Results**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 140+ | **Great Success.** The crew's quality score increases by 1 for `1d4` days. |
| 105–139 | **Success.** The ship survives unscathed. |
| 70–104 | **Partial Disaster.** Each component takes `4d10` bludgeoning damage. The crew's quality score is reduced by 1. The ship struggles, moving at half speed that day. |
| 0–69 | **Disaster.** The ship's components each take `10d10` bludgeoning damage. The crew's quality score drops by 2, as several members of the crew are washed overboard and lost. The ship is blown off course and struggles to recover its bearings, failing to cover any distance that day. |
^hazard-check-results

If you want to add variety to hazards, consider including some interesting complications. For example, a whirlpool might drag a ship to the Elemental Plane of Water on a disaster result, with the ship avoiding the vortex on any other result.

You can also add or subtract to the success thresholds in the Hazard Check Results table to reflect a hazard's danger. If you decide to do so, increase or decrease a threshold by 35.

### Other Events

In addition to rough seas and daunting weather, a ship might face a number of other threats.

The hazards below serve as examples of what can go wrong on a ship. Each one requires a different officer to spend a day dealing with the hazard instead of engaging in other activity. As a rule of thumb, there is a 10% chance chance each day that one of the following events occurs.

#### Emergency Maneuvers

The crew must react quickly to avoid a sudden threat. A kraken passes below the ship, threatening to capsize it in its wake, or the ship is about to crash into an uncharted reef. The captain must make a DC 15 Intelligence (water vehicles) check. On a failed check, the ship's hull takes `8d10` bludgeoning damage from the collision. On a successful check, the captain's quick direction keeps the ship out of harm.

#### Conflict

Life at sea is a mixture of monotony, hard work, and sudden moments of terror. The stress can wear on the stoutest sailor. Sometimes, that stress turns into conflict among the crew. If dissension spreads in the ranks, the first mate's activity that day must be spent making a DC 15 Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) check to control the crew. On a failed check, the crew's quality score decreases by `1d4`.

#### Fire

A fire at sea can render a ship unable to function. Pick a random component. It takes `4d10` fire damage unless the bosun succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md)) check.

#### Plague

An illness sweeps through the ranks, perhaps caused by rats or insects that made their way aboard. The surgeon must make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check. On a failed check, the crew's quality score decreases by 5 for `1d6` days.

#### Infestation

Beetles, rats, or other pests infest the ship, threatening its food stores. The cook must make a DC 15 Constitution ([brewer's supplies](/Systems/5e/items/brewers-supplies.md)) check to save what food they can. On a failed check, the crew has disadvantage on any checks involving its quality score until the ship has a chance to restock supplies.
