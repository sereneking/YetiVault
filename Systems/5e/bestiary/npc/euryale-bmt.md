# Euryale
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 189*  

When she retired from adventuring, Euryale relocated to Cair Ophidian, a small hideaway in the Outlands detailed later in chapter 22. There, Euryale embraced the quiet life of a gardener, and she spends her time tending to the plants she's cultivated around her home. However, should Asteria call for her aid, Euryale would venture across the multiverse without hesitation, battling tooth and nail to protect her sister.

Euryale has the petrifying gaze and venomous snaky hair of other medusas. But as an ancient and powerful druid, Euryale often adopts the form of a hulking serpent when threatened. She has attained precise control over her petrifying gaze, rendering her immune to its effects and allowing her to use it while not in her medusa guise. Despite her alarming appearance in serpent form, Euryale remains a healer and caretaker at heart.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Euryale makes three attacks. If she is in serpent form, only one of these attacks can be Constrict.

Until this grapple ends, the target takes 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, and Euryale can't constrict another target.

***Snake Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition until the start of Euryale's next turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** Euryale changes shape into her Huge serpent form or back into her Medium medusa form. Euryale's game statistics are the same in each form except where noted in this stat block. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. Euryale reverts to her medusa form if she dies.

***Petrifying Gaze (Recharge 4-6).*** Euryale unleashes petrifying magic from her eyes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw if it doesn't have the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) condition. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature has the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition. Otherwise, on a failed save, the creature takes 14 (`4d6`) force damage, begins to turn to stone, and has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. The [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a failed save, it has the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition, and on a successful save, the effect ends on it, The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the [Greater Restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or other magic A creature can use its reaction, if available, to shut its eyes to avoid the saving throw. If the creature does so, it has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) condition until the end of its next turn.
