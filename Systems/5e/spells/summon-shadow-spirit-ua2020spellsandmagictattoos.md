# Summon Shadow Spirit
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, tears inside a crystal vial worth at least 300 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a shadowy spirit from the Shadowfell. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Shadow Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an emotion: Fury, Despair, or Fear. The creature physically resembles a misshapen humanoid marked by the chosen emotion, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell's duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Warlock](/Systems/5e/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
