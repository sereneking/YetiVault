# Spaceship Trinket
*Adventuring Gear*  


The Spaceship Trinkets table below offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for adventures with sci-fi themes. The adventure includes encounters that ask you to roll on the table to determine what random trinkets the characters find in certain locations on the spaceship. None of the trinkets requires an energy cell.
