# Fzeglaich

## Salvage

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies can use 1 pint of blood from a fzeg and mix it with silver and other reagents worth 50 gp to create a [lycanthropy antidote](/Systems/5e/items/lycanthropy-antidote-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis). A slain fzeg has 10 (`1d4 + 2`) usable pints of blood. The blood of a fzeglaich can be used, but it takes five times as much blood and twice as long to brew. Creating the antidote takes 4 hours of work and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** A fzeg is a mix of werewolf and vampire but has fewer weaknesses. The creature is resistant to nonmagical attacks.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** With its bite, a fzeg can drain life force and curse a person with werewolf lycanthropy. Someone who dies from a fzeg's bite becomes a fzeglaich, a creature like the fzeg and loyal to it.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** A fzeg can transform into humanoid form. It's natural form, however, is that of a wolf-human hybrid. This vampiric monster isn't vulnerable to sunlight, but radiant damage prevents it from regenerating.  

> [!note] GM Advice
> 
> An ambitious DM could imagine a fzeg at the lead of a force including other werewolf-undead hybrids. Combined with a ghoul or ghast, the creature would paralyze, or combined with a wight, it would drain the life and lower the maximum hit points of a target. Similarly, other kinds of lycanthropes could become undead and wield hybrid powers.

## Traits

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The fzeglaich has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Rampage.*** When the fzeglaich reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the fzeglaich can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

***Regeneration.*** The fzeglaich regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the fzeglaich takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the fzeglaich's next turn.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fzeglaich makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until the end of its next turn. The fzeglaich regains hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (`2d4 + 3`) slashing damage.
