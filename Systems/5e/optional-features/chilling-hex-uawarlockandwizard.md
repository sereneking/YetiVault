# Chilling Hex
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Hexblade" Patron

As a bonus action, you cause frost to swirl around a target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse, dealing cold damage to each of your enemies within 5 feet of the target. The cold damage equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).
