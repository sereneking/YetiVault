**Breaking a Lesser Contract**

`dice: [](breaking-a-contract-breaking-a-lesser-contract-dod.md#^breaking-a-lesser-contract)`

| dice: d8 | Penalty |
|----------|---------|
| 1–2 | Your appearance becomes more toad-like (warty skin, bulbous eyes, large mouth, and webbed digits). This transformation has no game effects. |
| 3 | You smell like swamp gas. No amount of bathing can rid you of this stench. |
| 4 | Your shadow does not match your movements, which other creatures find unsettling. |
| 5–6 | Your appearance becomes more rat-like (beady eyes, whiskers, small ears, pointy nose, little hands and feet, and a rat's tail). This transformation has no game effects. |
| 7 | You cast no reflection. Superstitious folk who notice think you're a vampire. |
| 8 | You are constantly surrounded by a small cloud of annoying but harmless flies. |
