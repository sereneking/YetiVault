**Stage Four Encounters**

`dice: [](stage-four-pestilence-stage-four-encounters-vrgr.md#^stage-four-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A desperate group of [commoners](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) tries to break through a sealed gate to escape quarantine. Anyone who tries to aid or deter them must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 2 | Three thieves attack someone who cries out for help. If a character intervenes, all four thieves reveal themselves to be [wererats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) and attack. |
| 3 | A squad of Casques Silencieux ([animated armor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md)) marches through the street. If the Casques Silencieux spot a character, they try to force the character into a home where the residents are all dead. |
| 4 | The character spots several rats in an alley using trash to enact a miniature courtroom drama. If a character interrupts or is critical of the rats' play, the rats become a [swarm of rats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md) and attack. |
| 5 | The character notices a [giant rat](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md) about to throw alchemist's fire at an inhabited home. If they intervene, the rat flees. Whether or not it escapes, the character's lodgings are soon the target of arson. |
| 6 | A celebration takes place in a nearby house. Six [wererats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) openly cavort in hybrid form, dancing and carousing with the corpses of the home's former owners. |
