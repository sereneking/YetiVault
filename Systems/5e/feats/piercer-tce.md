# Piercer
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 80*  

You have achieved a penetrating precision in combat, granting you the following benefits:

- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals piercing damage, you can reroll one of the attack's damage dice, and you must use the new roll.  
- When you score a critical hit that deals piercing damage to a creature, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra piercing damage the target takes.
