# Unerring Spell
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 10*  

If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcery points to reroll the attack roll. You must use the result of the second roll.

You can use Unerring Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
