| dice: d8 | Object |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A statue of a beautiful Fey who appears to be laughing, crying, or scowling, depending on the viewer's mood; the dragon requires all who visit to describe the face and sends away anyone who sees an angry visage |
| 2 | A string of leaves collected from the rarest trees in the Feywild and then dipped in silver |
| 3 | A small mithral ball that shows significant scuffing, as the dragon plays with it constantly |
| 4 | A mobile from which hang six figurines of pixies and sprites; the dragon insists that Fey allies address any questions and concerns to the figurines |
| 5 | A painting of a beautiful Feywild vista; the dragon studies the painting every day for clues about the vista's whereabouts |
| 6 | An ornate silver chest that holds a mountain of gold coins; the dragon refuses to open the chest, claiming it can still smell the stink of the "noxious metal" |
| 7 | A collection of gem-encrusted pitchers, decanters, and goblets; the dragon will not consume faerie nectar unless it is served in one of these items |
| 8 | A vast bookshelf full of dream journals written by creatures the dragon has befriended over the years; the dragon has each entry illustrated by a different celebrated artist, making the library one of the largest art collections in the world |
