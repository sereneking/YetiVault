| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A white dragon has been starving out a fortified settlement by decimating the local caribou herds. |
| 2 | The words of a ritual to propitiate a vengeful spirit are tattooed on the flesh of a frost giant druid—who is entombed in the ice of a white dragon's lair. |
| 3 | [Aarakocra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/aarakocra.md) have become a nuisance in the lowlands ever since they were driven out of their mountain aerie by the arrival of a white dragon. |
| 4 | An item stolen from a white dragon's hoard has been passed down to an adventurer as a family heirloom—and the dragon is coming to get it back. |
| 5 | After driving away a white dragon, a group of adventurers discovered a mighty demon trapped in the ice in the dragon's lair. Now the ice is melting and the demon will soon awaken—so the dragon must be lured back. |
| 6 | A white dragon has been raiding distant farmlands, procuring gifts of food for a mate with a taste for unusual cuisine. |
| 7 | A white dragon has been exacting vengeance on a rival silver dragon by killing off the silver dragon's Humanoid companions. |
| 8 | A [frost giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/frost-giant.md) wants to subdue a white dragon, hoping to overthrow the current frost giant jarl with the dragon's aid. In exchange for assistance from adventurers, the giant promises peace between the giant clan and nearby settlements. |
