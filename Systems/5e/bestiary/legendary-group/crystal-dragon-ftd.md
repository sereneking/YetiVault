# Crystal Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Beguiling Whisper.** The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.  
- **Ice Passage.** The dragon can open a passage through a wall of ice or snow that is up to 5 feet thick, creating an opening up to 30 feet wide and high.  
- **Starlight's Gleam.** The dragon chooses a point it can see in the lair. Gleaming starlight radiates from that point to fill a 10-foot-radius sphere with dim light. Each creature other than the dragon in that area when the light appears must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (`2d12`) radiant damage and be outlined in the glow. [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) rolls made against an outlined creature have advantage, and the creature can't hide or benefit from being [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible). The starlight and the glow around any creature fades on initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region surrounding a legendary crystal dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Clear Skies.** The skies above a crystal dragon's lair remain clear and free of precipitation unless magically altered. Winds blow lightly, posing little threat to those approaching the lair, and visibility is the best possible for the time of day.  
- **Crystal Profusion.** Plentiful quartz crystals form in natural stone within 6 miles of the lair, particularly in places where natural light can shine on the crystals.  
- **Icy Sight.** Ice and quartz within 6 miles of the lair become conduits for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any ice or quartz crystals in that region.  
- **Positive Energy.** Any creature that finishes a long rest within 6 miles of the lair regains two additional spent Hit Dice.  
- **Thriving Wildlife.** Animal populations flourish within 6 miles of the lair. Ability checks made to forage for food by hunting, fishing, or trapping in that area are made with advantage.  

If the dragon dies, the animal population near the lair returns to normal levels over the course of `1d10` days. The increased Hit Die recovery ends immediately. The existing abundance of quartz crystals remains, but new crystals form at a normal rate.
