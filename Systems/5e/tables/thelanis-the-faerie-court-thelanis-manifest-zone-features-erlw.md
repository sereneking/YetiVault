| 1 | Fey trees whose wood is imbued with magical properties grow here, along with a copse of guardian [treants](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/treant.md) and awakened flora. |
| 2 | A circle of mushrooms serves as a portal to Thelanis when the proper offering is placed in its center. |
| 3 | An eladrin commune that holds powerful esoteric knowledge is nestled in the depths of a forest inhabited by large numbers of [pixies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/pixie.md). |
| 4 | The magic of the fey runs deep here. Saving throws against enchantment and illusion spells are made with disadvantage. |
