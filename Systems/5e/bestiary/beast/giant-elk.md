# Giant Elk
*Source: Monster Manual p. 325, Storm King's Thunder. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

The majestic giant elk is rare to the point that its appearance is often taken as a foreshadowing of an important event, such as the birth of a king. Legends tell of gods that take the form of giant elk when visiting the Material Plane. Many cultures therefore believe that to hunt these creatures is to invite divine wrath.
