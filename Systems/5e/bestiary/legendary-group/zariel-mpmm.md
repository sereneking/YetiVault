# Zariel

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take one of the following lair actions; she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Fireball.** Zariel casts the [fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md) spell.  
- **Infernal Illusions.** Zariel casts the [major image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md) spell four times, targeting different areas with it. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the illusion for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Zariel's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Hellscape.** The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.  
- **Pyres.** Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (`2d6` fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.  
- **Smoke.** The area within 2 miles of the lair, but no closer than 500 feet, is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can't be cleared away.  

If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
