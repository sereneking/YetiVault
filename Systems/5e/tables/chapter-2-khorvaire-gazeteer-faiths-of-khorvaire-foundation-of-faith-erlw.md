| dice: d6 | Foundation |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | You were raised in the faith. Your religion is an important part of your family and community. |
| 2 | Someone you care about—a mentor, a friend, or a lover—introduced you to the faith. |
| 3 | You were raised in a different religion but became drawn to the ideals and beliefs of your current faith. |
| 4 | You never took your faith seriously. Then you made a vow during the Last War, pledging your devotion if a disaster was averted... and it was. |
| 5 | You're devoted to your religion, but you've never been formally educated in its ways. You follow your own personal interpretation. |
| 6 | You had a transcendental experience and believe you have a divine purpose to fulfill. |
