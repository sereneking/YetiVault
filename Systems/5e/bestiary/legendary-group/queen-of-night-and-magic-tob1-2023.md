# Queen of Night and Magic

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Night and Magic takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Queen of Night and Magic can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Demoralizing Assault.** Visions of hopelessness and despair assail the mind of one creature the Queen can see within 60 feet of her. The creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Extinguish Light.** Each source of magical or nonmagical bright light within 60 feet of the Queen becomes dim light, and each source of magical or nonmagical dim light within 60 feet of her becomes darkness. This effect lasts until the Queen uses this lair action again, until she dismisses it as a bonus action, or until she dies.  
- **Wall of Shadow.** An opaque wall of writhing shadows springs up from a solid surface within 120 feet of the Queen. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage. Creatures in the wall's space are pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall they choose. A creature can move through the wall, but the semi-material shadow resists intrusion. For every 1 foot a creature travels through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. A creature that starts its turn in the wall or enters the wall's space for the first time on a turn must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall dissipates when the Queen uses this lair action again or when she dies.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the Queen of Night and Magic's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Constant Surveillance.** The Queen of Night and Magic can cast her senses to any area containing darkness, dim light, or shadows within 6 miles of her lair. This effect works like the clairvoyance spell, except its range is 6 miles.  
- **Living Shadow.** Shadows come to life within 6 miles of the Queen's lair. Most of the time these living shadows are unnerving and nothing more, but when a creature acts against the interests of the Queen, the shadows can interfere and cause the creature to have disadvantage on ability checks made to act against her interests.  
- **Magically Active.** Magic saturates the area within 6 miles of the lair, causing temporary, minor, and harmless magical effects, like random aromas wafting through the air, sudden chills, spontaneous motes of light dancing in the sky, and similar.  

If the Queen of Night and Magic dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
