# Jell Platena
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 199*  

Jell is a bespectacled sera luma with bright red plumage resembling a cardinal. Jell has studied at the Avium for three years now, and is well on her way to becoming a graduate. She is bright and studious, and serious about everything she does in life. Jell uses the commoner stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a sera luma. She is neutral good.
