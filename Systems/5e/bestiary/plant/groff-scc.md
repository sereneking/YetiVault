# Groff
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 194*  

Many a Strixhaven student wandering the bayou has stepped on a seemingly mundane patch of moss—only to discover that it was the back of a hungry groff lurking beneath the surface. These shaggy swamp creatures have canine faces and glowing blue eyes, and they are ravenous carnivores—with pest mascots being their favorite food. A handful of more intrepid Witherbloom mages have learned to follow groffs in order to track down pest mascots, but most of these mages have yet to find a way to capture the pests before the groff eats someone.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the groff is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the groff move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the groff isn't an ordinary moss-covered bog patch.

***Hold Breath.*** The groff can hold its breath for up to 1 hour.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The groff makes one Bite attack and one Swamp Claw attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) piercing damage.

***Swamp Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or become engulfed by the groff. While engulfed, the target can't breathe, is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and takes 10 (`3d6`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. When the groff moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The groff can have only one target engulfed at a time.

An engulfed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns. On a success, the target escapes and enters the nearest unoccupied space.
