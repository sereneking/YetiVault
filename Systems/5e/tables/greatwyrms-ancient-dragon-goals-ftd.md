`dice: [](greatwyrms-ancient-dragon-goals-ftd.md#^ancient-dragon-goals)`

| dice: d6 | Goal |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Avoid decline by becoming Undead or seeking magical alternatives to aging |
| 2 | Transcend the limits of physical existence on a single world by uniting echoes across multiple worlds or establishing a lair on another plane of existence |
| 3 | Acquire a particular artifact, perhaps to complete a set (all three parts of the Regalia of Evil, the [Eye of Vecna](/Systems/5e/items/eye-of-vecna.md) and [Hand of Vecna](/Systems/5e/items/hand-of-vecna.md), and so forth) |
| 4 | Collect a complete set of artistic treasures, such as all the paintings of a great master, manuscripts for a famed author's entire body of writings, or every piece of jewelry made by a master artisan |
| 5 | Transform an entire world into an extreme environment suitable as a lairâ€”a volcanic hellscape, a frozen wonderland, an arid wasteland, or the like |
| 6 | Destroy one or more gods as an act of vengeance or to ascend to godhood |
