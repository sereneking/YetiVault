# Gnoll Havoc Runner
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 212*  

*A sprinting gnoll laughs as it runs, axe held high and flashing in the sun.*

With the bristly mane and spotted fur characteristic of all gnolls, havoc runners blend into their tribe. Only the canny glint in the eyes hints at the deadly difference before the havoc runner explodes into violence.

## Blinding Raids

Havoc runners are scouring storms across the trade routes that crisscross the tribe's territory. Like all gnolls, they are deadly in battle. Havoc runners incorporate another quality that makes them the envy of many raiders: they can tell at a glance which pieces of loot from a laden camel or wagon are the most valuable, without spending time rummaging, weighing, or evaluating. Their ability to strike into a caravan, seize the best items, and withdraw quickly is unparalleled.
