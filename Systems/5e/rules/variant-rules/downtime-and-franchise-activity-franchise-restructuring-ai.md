# Downtime and Franchise Activity: Franchise Restructuring
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 38* 

A growing franchise often needs fine-tuning to improve its operations and remain lean and capable. Efficiency measures, bold new paradigms, shiny business plans, internal audits, and inventory management can be key to new profits. The best plans often end up creating an auxiliary market for "how-to" books, such as *Can't-Miss Principles of Franchise Reinvisionary Strategery* and *What to Inquire about How to Acquire*. In some campaigns, Head Office might periodically require this task to ensure that a franchise grows effectively.

## Resources

Boldly restructuring a franchise requires at least two workweeks of effort. The franchise must also spend 100 gp per franchise rank in expenses. Spending more time and money increases the characters' chance to effectively restructure their franchise.

## Resolution

Characters or staff members in charge of the restructuring make two ability checks with a DC of 13 + franchise rank. First, a character or staff member must succeed at either an Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)) or Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check to select the right vision or identify the right areas to innovate. This check gains a +1 bonus for every character with the loremonger or hoardsperson position in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.

A character or staff member must then make a Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance), or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to get all other characters and staff on board with the prescribed changes. This check gains a +1 bonus for each decisionist or secretarian in the franchise, and an additional +1 bonus if the character making the check has one of those positions.

All checks gain a +1 bonus for every two workweeks beyond the initial time that is spent undertaking this activity. Each check also gains a +1 bonus for every additional 100 gp spent over the baseline expenses. A maximum bonus of +10 can be applied to each check.

The total number of successes determines the outcome of the activity, as noted on the Franchise Restructuring table.

**Franchise Restructuring**

| Successes | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| 0 | The restructuring plan is a failure. The franchise's monthly costs increase by 20 percent for 1 month. |
| 1 | The restructuring plan provides minor benefits. The franchise's monthly costs decrease by 10 percent for `1d4` months. |
| 2 | The restructuring plan provides strong benefits. The franchise's monthly costs decrease by 20 percent for `1d4` months. |

## Complications

A result of 0 successes typically indicates that the failed restructuring results in a complication. At the DM's discretion, even a successful outcome might have unexpected side effects. The DM can choose a complication or roll on the Franchise Restructuring Complications table.

**Franchise Restructuring Complications**

`dice: [](downtime-and-franchise-activity-franchise-restructuring-ai.md#^franchise-restructuring-complications)`

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | The restructuring plan has too many buzzwords and acronyms. The resulting confusion sees shipments or staff sent to dangerous locations. A side trek adventure is required to recover the lost goods or personnel. |
| 2 | The changes to the franchise alienate an important staff member, who takes one of the franchise's best practices or secrets to a rival.* |
| 3 | The search for efficiency uncovers a previously unrecognized issue, such as corruption, problems with staff dynamics, or influence from a rival.* |
| 4 | An audit reveals that one of the staff members was a spy, feeding secrets to a rival. The spy escapes, possibly inspiring a side trek adventure to catch them.* |
| 5 | The restructuring efforts produce lingering chaos. The next two times a check is made for a downtime or franchise activity in the campaign, the check is made with disadvantage. |
| 6 | A staff member becomes outraged by the changes and secretly begins to undermine the franchise. The characters must uncover the culprit and decide how to deal with them.* |
