# Redcap
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 306*  

*This grizzled, weather-beaten creature looks like a sour old man, complete with scraggly beard. It carries a great pike and wears a blood-soaked hat and heavy boots shod with iron. It grins with massive yellow teeth*.

## Blood-Soaked Caps

Redcaps are exceedingly dangerous creatures who wear the mark of their cruelty and evil quite literally. The caps from which they take their name define their very existenceâ€”these caps must constantly be revived with fresh blood.

## Compelled to Kill

Redcaps aren't cruel and murderous by choice, but by necessity. A redcap must frequently bathe its cap in fresh, humanoid blood to sustain itself. If it fails to do so every three days, the creature withers and dies quickly. A redcap whose hat is nearly dry is a desperate, violent force of nature that prefers to die in battle rather than waste away to nothing.

## Bandits and Mercenaries

Most long-lived redcaps are drawn to serve in marauding armies or make a living through constant banditry.

## Traits

***Red Cap.*** The redcap must soak its cap in the blood of a Humanoid that has been dead for no more than 1 hour at least once every 3 days. Every 24 hours past the third day that it goes without soaking its cap in blood in this way, it suffers one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). This [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) can be reduced only when the redcap finishes a long rest after soaking its cap in fresh Humanoid blood, which reduces its [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level to 0. If the redcap dies as a result of this [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), it crumbles to dust.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The redcap makes one Bleeding Bite attack and two Pike attacks.

***Bleeding Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than a Construct or Undead, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or lose 7 `2d6` hp at the start of each of its turns due to a bleeding wound. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to stanch the wound with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check. The wound also closes if the target receives magical healing.

***Pike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d10 + 5`) piercing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Solid Kick.*** The redcap kicks a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
