## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Shuushar can breathe air and water.

***Otherworldly Perception.*** Shuushar can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

***Slippery.*** Shuushar has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Shuushar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d4 + 1`) piercing damage.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, or 5 (`1d8 + 1`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* The target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.

## Reactions

***Sticky Shield.*** When a creature misses Shuushar with a melee weapon attack, Shuushar uses its sticky shield to catch the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to Shuushar's shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding.
