# Carousing
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 5* 

Carousing is a good default downtime activity for most characters. Between adventures, who doesn't want to relax with a few drinks and a group of friends at the local pub?

## Resources

Carousing covers a workweek of fine food, strong drink, and socializing. A character can attempt to carouse among lower-, middle-, or upper-class folk. A character can carouse with the lower class for 25 gp to cover expenses, or 100 gp for the middle class. Carousing with the upper class requires 500 gp for the workweek and access to the local nobility.

A character with the noble background can mingle with the upper class, but other characters can do so only if you, as DM, judge that the character has made sufficient contacts.

## Resolution

After a workweek of carousing, a character stands to make contacts within the selected social class. The character makes a Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check using the Carousing table.

**Carousing**

| Check | Total Result |
|-------|--------------|
| 1–5 Character has made a hostile contact. | 6–10 No effect results. |
| 11–15 Character has made an allied contact. | 16–20 Character has made two allied contacts. |
| 21+ Character has made three allied contacts. |  |

Contacts are NPCs who now share a bond with the character. Each one owes the character a favor or has some reason to bear a grudge. A hostile one works against the character, placing obstacles but stopping short of committing a crime or violence. Allied contacts are friends who will render aid to the character, but will not risk their lives.

A harmful contact might point the town guard in the character's direction or argue with a character who tries to rally the town to a cause. Helpful contacts stand by the character and help in any way possible.

Low-class contacts include criminals, laborers, mercenaries, the town guard, and any other folk who would frequent the cheapest taverns in town.

Middle-class contacts include guild members, spellcasters, town officials, and other folk who would frequent more upscale establishments.

Upper-class contacts are nobles and their direct servants. Carousing in this case covers formal banquets, state dinners, and the like.

Once a contact has helped or hindered a character, the character needs to carouse again to get back into the NPC's good graces. A contact provides help once, not help for life. The contact remains friendly, and that can influence roleplay and how the characters interact with them, but it doesn't come with a guarantee of help.

You can assign specific NPCs as contacts. You might decide that the barkeep at the Wretched Gorgon and a guard stationed at the western gate are the character's allied contacts. Assigning specific NPCs gives the players concrete options. It brings the campaign to life and seeds the area with NPCs that the characters care about. On the other hand, it can prove difficult to track and might render a contact useless if it doesn't come into play.

Alternatively, you can allow the player to make an NPC a contact on the spot, after carousing. When the characters are in the area in which they caroused, a player can expend an allied contact and designate an NPC they meet as a contact, assuming the NPC is of the correct social class based on how the character caroused. The player should provide a reasonable explanation for this relationship and work it into the game.

Using a mix of the two approaches is a good idea, since it gives you the added depth of specific contacts while giving players the freedom to ensure that the contacts they accumulate are useful.

The same process can apply to hostile contacts. You can give the characters a specific NPC they should avoid, or you might introduce one at an inopportune or a dramatic moment.

A character can have a number of unspecified allied contacts at a time no higher than 1 + the character's Charisma modifier (minimum of 1). Specific, named contacts don't count toward this limit, only ones that can be used at any time to declare an NPC as a contact.

Characters who carouse risk bar brawls, accumulating a cloud of nasty rumors, and building a bad reputation around town. You can roll on the carousing complications tables to create a complication, pick one as you see fit, or make your own. As a rule of thumb, there is a 10% chance chance that a character triggers a complication for each workweek of carousing.
