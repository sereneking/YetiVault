# Baphomet

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet creates this effect again.  
- Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.  
- Baphomet casts [mirage arcane](/Systems/5e/spells/mirage-arcane.md), affecting a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing Baphomet's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.  
- Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Baphomet table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

### Madness of Baphomet

If a creature goes mad in Baphomet's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Baphomet table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.
