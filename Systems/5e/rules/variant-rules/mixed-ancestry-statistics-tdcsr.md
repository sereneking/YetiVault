# Mixed Ancestry Statistics
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 164* 

Only certain combinations of ancestries, such as [half-elves](/Systems/5e/races/half-elf.md) and [half-orcs](/Systems/5e/races/half-orc.md), already have racial traits described in the fifth edition core rules. You can use these racial traits as is, or create your own "mixed ancestry" from any two races by choosing one or two racial traits from one parent's race and exchanging them for the same number of traits from another parent's race.

When you build a character of "mixed ancestry", keep in mind that some racial traits are more mechanically powerful than others, while some are largely flavorful or narrative focused. As such, focus on swapping a narrative trait for another narrative trait, or a combat-focused trait for another combat-focused trait. Additionally, you must have your Game Master's permission to use your replacement traits. As with any house rule, you and your Game Master might want to revisit your unique combination of traits later in the campaign if they feel overpowered or underpowered.
