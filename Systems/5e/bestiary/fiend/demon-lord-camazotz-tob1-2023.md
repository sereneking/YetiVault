# Demon Lord Camazotz
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 76*  

*This hunched, lean man is covered in short, black fur and has large, membranous wings. His lips, pulled back in a sinister smile, reveal a mouth lined with crooked, needlelike teeth. His eyes glow red like burning embers of hate. Long arms end in cruel claws, and the air around him shimmers with waves of intense heat*.

## Underworld Bat Lord

Camazotz, the Lord of Bats and Fire, is a being of pure savagery and hatred—a vile demon that holds sway over bats, vampires, and the lightless places of the underworld. In the deep recesses of the earth and the caves connecting to the surface, he waits restlessly until the slow creep of night engulfs the land, releasing him to feed and spread terror.

## New Fiery Mantle

Recently, Camazotz stole the fire aspect of the decrepit Huhueteotl, Lord of the Hearth and the Fire of Life. With his new prestige, Camazotz has attracted new followers, served notice to the gods of his ascendancy, and solidified his place in the Abyss as a power to be respected. Cults of derro, goblins, and humans praise his name in the darkness.

## Emerging from Darkness

Like the bats he commands, Camazotz much prefers darkness to light, but with his new ability to play with fire and light, he grows increasingly confident in daylight.

> [!note] Camazotz in the Real World
> 
> A cult dedicated to an anthropomorphic deity with the body of a human and the head of a bat emerged around 100 BCE with the Zapotec Indians of southwest Mexico. This god was associated with night, death, and sacrifice. In time, the veneration of Camazotz, or Cama Zotz (translated as "death bat" or "snatch bat"), found its way into Maya lore.
> 
> In older editions of the world's greatest roleplaying game, there was some debate as to whether Zotzilaha was another name for Camazotz, but in Central American lore, there was no debate. The Popol Vuh, a sacred Maya text, clearly identifies Zotzilaha as the cavernous "house of bats" where Camazotz resides, not an entity.
> 
> The Camazotz myth may have sprung from a real creature. Fossil records found in Central and South America dating back approximately 2,000 years reveal the existence of an abnormally large bat with a wingspan of as much as 10 feet! This super-bat, called*Desmodus draculae*, may have co-existed with the early Zapotecs and been the source of their Camazotz legends.
> 
> Belief in bat demons is widespread throughout Mesoamerica: Hik'al, or "neck-slitter," of Chiapas; Socouyant of Trinidad; and Tin Tin of Ecuador. Cryptozoologists believe that those monstrous bats may still be alive today, as reports of giant, bat-like creatures occasionally surface throughout Latin America, from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas to Brazil, from Puerto Rico to Mexico.

## Traits

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches Camazotz or hits him with a melee attack while within 5 feet of him takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.

***Keen Hearing.*** Camazotz has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Camazotz fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Camazotz has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Camazotz casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22):

**At will**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Camazotz makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 38 (`8d6 + 10`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving throw or its Strength score is reduced by `1d4`. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. A Humanoid that dies from this reduction rises `1d4` days later as a vampire under Camazotz's control, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Camazotz can have no more than five vampires under his control at a time.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 31 (`6d6 + 10`) slashing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Camazotz exhales unholy fire in a 30‑foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (`6d10`) fire damage and 33 (`6d10`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Call Bats (3/Day).*** Camazotz magically calls `4d6` giant bats or swarms of bats, or he magically calls `2d6` vrocks that have membranous instead of feathered wings. The called creatures arrive in `1d4` rounds, acting as allies of Camazotz and obeying his telepathic commands. The creatures remain for 1 hour, until Camazotz dies, or until Camazotz dismisses them as a bonus action. Camazotz can have no more than twenty four giant bats or swarms of bats, or twelve vrocks under his control at a time.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** Camazotz magically transforms into a Large giant bat covered in smoldering ashes, or back into his true form, which is a Fiend. His statistics, other than his size, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying transforms with him. He turns into a pile of greasy ash if destroyed.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** Camazotz makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Move.*** Camazotz moves up to his speed, or he flies up to half his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Camazotz uses Spellcasting.

***Fiery Wing Beat (Costs 2 Actions).*** Camazotz beats his wings, extinguishing mundane and magical light sources. Each creature within 10 feet of Camazotz must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) fire damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
