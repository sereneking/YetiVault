**White Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-white-dragon-white-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^white-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Rapacity. When a creature has the misfortune of crossing my path, I ask myself two questions: Am I hungry now? And if not, will I be hungry later? (Any) |
| 2 | Survival. This world is harsh and unforgiving, and so am I. I do whatever it takes to survive. (Any) |
| 3 | Dominance. I delight in making others tremble, knowing that I could kill them at any time. (Evil) |
| 4 | Isolation. All creatures are either prey or rivals. What do you mean by "company?" (Any) |
| 5 | Vengeance. Every scar upon my scales, every treasure beyond my reach, is a slight that must be answered. (Evil) |
| 6 | Service. I used to live as a beast, before learning what is possible when creatures put aside their petty needs in service of a greater goal. (Lawful) |
