## Salvage

Within every mjork is a heart of ash hardened into smoky crystal. This crystal might already be broken in the remains of a slain mjork, making it useless. An intact crystal can be broken or hurled at a point up to 60 feet away as an action. When it breaks, which it does upon landing if hurled, the crystal releases a 20-foot-radius sphere of sooty smoke, centered on a point in the breaker's space or on the point where the crystal landed. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute, but a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it in 4 rounds. A strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. These crystals sell for 15 gp or more each.

The smaller crystals from sootlings or broken mjork crystals are like smoky quartz. These gems can be worth from 1 sp to 1 gp each, or more to collectors who believe they are mjork crystals. Someone who polishes them using jeweler's tools can increase their value as semiprecious stones.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Mjorks are made from earth and fire clashing together. These elementals often dwell near volcanoes.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Mjorks are vulnerable to thunder damage, which cracks their rocky skin. They can also sense through smoke as if the haze provided them blindsight.

## Traits

***Hot Soot.*** A creature that ends its turn in the sootling swarm's space takes 5 (`2d4`) fire damage, or 2 (`1d4`) fire damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The creature must also succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and unable to breathe until the end of its next turn.

***Smoke Sense.*** A sootling swarm in contact with smoke has blindsight in that smoke's area in a radius of up to 120 feet.

***Swarm.*** The sootling swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points

***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the sootling swarm moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 2 cold damage.

## Actions

***Burns.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 10 (`4d4`) fire damage, or 5 (`2d4`) fire damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
