# Eliza Pennygleam
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 196*  

Eliza Pennygleam is an eluran, a group of cat-like people from the west. While not native to Humblewood, elurans are commonly seen along the roads as part of merchant caravans, and behind merchant stalls in the capital. Eliza is a savvy merchant, on her way to Alderheart to take over her late sister's shop. She is a natural bargainer, but she is also charitable to those who have faced hardships. Eliza uses the [commoner](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) stat block. She is neutral good.
