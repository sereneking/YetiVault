# Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 215*  

Knight-Captain Theodore Marshal is a man in his prime. He is athletic and tall with boldly sculpted features, bronzed skin, and unkempt sandy brown hair. Unshaven stubble has grown into a beard over the criss-cross of scars on his face. A leather patch covers his right eye. He wears gleaming silver plate armour etched with golden trim, and carries a shimmering sword and a broad shield engraved with the symbol of the Sacred Flame.

-     - **Personality Trait.** I act with determined calm and respect. Little rouses my anger, instead I respond with disappointment when others incite my ire.    
-     - **Ideal.** I believe that good-hearted people can set aside their differences to work together.    
-     - **Bond.** I am willing to lay down my life for a just and righteous cause.    
-     - **Flaw.** I will never give up on my comrades. I do not trade lives.
