# Arcanist
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 1*  

You study the arcane arts, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You learn the [prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md) and [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) spells. You can cast [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
