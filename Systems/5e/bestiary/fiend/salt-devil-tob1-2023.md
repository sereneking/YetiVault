# Salt Devil
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 100*  

*The creature's skin sparkles with fine salt crystals as it brandishes a scimitar and jagged claws.*

## Sparkly Crystals

Salt devils have sharp, crystalline teeth, sparkling skin studded with fine salt crystals, and long claws that leave jagged, burning wounds. They can also fight with saltâ€‘encrusted blades seemingly forged from thin air.

## Servants of Mammon

Salt devils claim to serve the devil-god Mammon. They often ally with gnolls and slavers with whom they seek out oases to use as ambush sites or just to poison the water.

## Slavers and Corruptors

Salt devils create slave markets and salt mines, where they thrive on the misery of those indentured into their service. They often forge alliances with mortals when partners are needed for an endeavor, and they are less grasping and greedy than one might expect of Mammon's servants, preferring to encourage corruption in others.

## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the salt devil's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The salt devil has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Salt-Encrusted Hide.*** A creature that touches the salt devil or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (`1d6`) slashing damage.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The salt devil makes two Scimitar attacks and one Water-Draining Claw attack.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Water-Draining Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Plants, Oozes, and creatures with the Amphibious, Water Breathing, or Water Form traits have disadvantage on this saving throw. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target also suffers one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).

***Teleport (3/Day).*** The salt devil magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
