# Chort Devil
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 93*  

*Small horns crown this pig-faced devil's head. It stands on shaggy goat legs and holds a flaming polearm in its clawed hands. It bears a wicked gleam in its black eyes*.

## Bad Bargains

Quick and canny, a chort devil delights in enticing mortals to make terrible bargains. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive victims. After all, the chort affirms, if the victims weren't so desperate, they wouldn't be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the devil is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, as that voids any potential contract.

## Recitation of Contracts

Occasionally, some poor fool believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a lover, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim's affairs are present to hear the recitation, and it disappears once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.

## Smear Tactics

An opponent of the chort often finds itself the victim of its own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about the opponent. For example, it may steal a paladin's sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to a potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.
