## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The head has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Psychic Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`3d10`) psychic damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Leech.*** The head targets one creature within 5 feet of itself and forces the target to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the head enters the target's space and attaches to the target. While the head is attached, the target takes 7 (`3d4`) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns, and the head can't use Leech again until it detaches. It can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. As an action, the target or a creature within 5 feet of the target can detach the head by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.
