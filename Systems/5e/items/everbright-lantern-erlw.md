# Everbright Lantern
*Wondrous Item, common*  


This bullseye lantern contains an Eberron dragonshard that sheds light comparable to that produced by a [continual flame](/Systems/5e/spells/continual-flame.md) spell. An everbright lantern sheds light in a 120-foot cone; the closest 60 feet is bright light, and the farthest 60 feet is dim light.
