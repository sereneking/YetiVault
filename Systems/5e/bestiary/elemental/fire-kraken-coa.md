## Traits

***Freedom of Movement.*** The kraken ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or grapples.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the kraken fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes two attacks using its Tentacle, Fling, or a combination of the two.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`3d6 + 8`) piercing damage and 7 (`2d6`) fire damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the kraken, the creature is swallowed and the grapple ends. While swallowed, a creature has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) conditions, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the kraken, and takes 42 (`12d6`) fire damage at the start of the kraken's turns. If the kraken takes 50 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall into a space within 10 feet of the kraken and now have the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. If the kraken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting with the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d4 + 8`) fire damage. If the target is a Huge or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 16). While [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled), the target also has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. Any target that starts its turn [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the kraken takes 5 (`2d4`) fire damage. The kraken has five tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object or creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the kraken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction, and now has the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked down with the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

## Legendary Actions

***Appendage.*** The kraken makes a Fling attack.

***Fire Breath (Costs 3 Actions).*** The kraken exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (`8d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
