# Blightscale Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an adult or ancient blightscale dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects. The dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Insects burst from a hive built on a surface that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature within 20 feet of the hive must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in the cloud takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage. The insects disperse on initiative count 20 of the next round. They disperse early if subjected to intense wind or a damaging area effect.  
- Puslike fluid erupts in a 20-foot radius centered on a point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature moving through this terrain must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15) by the sucking glop and restrained while grappled in this way. Another creature can pull a restrained target free by taking an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength (  
- [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)  
- ) check. The ground dries sufficiently to return to normal on initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- Foul gas belches forth in a 20-foot-radius sphere from a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. Each creature within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned. Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. This cloud disperses on initiative count 20 of the next round. It disperses early if subjected to intense wind.
