# Buying a Magic Item
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 5* 

Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee they will have the desired items.

## Resources

Finding magic items to purchase requires one workweek of effort and 100 gp minimum in expenses. Spending more time and money increases your chance of finding a high-quality item.

## Resolution

A character seeking to buy a magic item makes a Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to determine the quality of seller found. The character gains a +1 bonus for every workweek beyond the first spent seeking a seller and a +1 bonus for every 100 gp spent on the search. The total bonus for time and money spent can't be greater than +10.

As shown on the Buying Magic Items table, the total of the check dictates which table in the Dungeon Master's Guide to roll on to determine which items are on the market.

Using the Magic Item Price table, you then assign prices to the available items, based on their rarity. Halve the price of any consumable item—such as a potion or a scroll—when using the table to determine an asking price. You have final say in determining which items are for sale and their final price, no matter what the tables say.

If the characters seek a specific magic item, first decide if it's an item you want to allow in the game. If so, include the item among the offerings if it appears on a table that the result allows you to roll on.

## Complications

The magic item trade is fraught with dangers. The large sums of money involved, and the power offered by a magic item, attract thieves, con artists, and other villains. If you want to make things more interesting for the characters, roll on the Magic Item Purchase Complications table or invent your own complication.
