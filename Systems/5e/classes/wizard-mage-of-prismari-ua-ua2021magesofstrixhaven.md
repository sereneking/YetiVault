## Class Features

### Mage of Prismari (Level 1)

*Druid, Sorcerer, and Wizard Subclass*

Mages of Prismari use surges of elemental energy to express who they are and how they see the world. To them, magic and motion are one and the same; both are exhibitions of raw creativity through which masterpieces are made. In their pursuit of the arts, some Prismari mages focus on perfecting the fine details of their technique, while others prefer to unleash their wild creative visions in dazzling spectacles of elemental power.

#### Using This Subclass

Upon selecting the Mage of Prismari subclass, you gain two features: Creative Skills and Kinetic Artistry.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Prismari counts as your circle; if you're a sorcerer, the magic of the college is the origin of your sorcery; and if you're a wizard, the college represents your arcane tradition.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Creative Skills (Level 1)

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You gain proficiency in two of the following skills of your choice: [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance).

### Kinetic Artistry (Level 1)

*Level 1+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You can [Dash](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dash) as a bonus action. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

- **Boreal Sweep.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.  
- **Scorching Whirl.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to `1d4` + your spellcasting modifier.  
- **Thunderlight Jaunt.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.  

You can use a bonus action in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Favored Medium (Level 6)

*Level 6+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

You have honed your forms of elemental expression to best suit your ideas. Choose one of the following damage types: cold, fire, or lightning. You gain resistance to that damage type.

Additionally, when you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals the chosen damage type, you emit a spectacular aura of artistry, which extends 5 feet from you in every direction (but not through total cover) and lasts until the end of your next turn. While the aura is active, each creature of your choice has resistance to your chosen damage type while within the aura, as you shape your favored elemental medium around them.

You can change your choice of damage type whenever you finish a long rest.

### Focused Expression (Level 10)

*Level 10+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Honing your talents, you skillfully infuse your motions with even more potent expressions of elemental might. Once per turn when you deal damage to at least one target, you gain an additional effect determined by the damage type chosen for your Favored Medium feature:

- **Cold.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional `1d6` cold damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as ice mires it. A target can be affected by the ice only once per round.  
- **Fire.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional `1d6` fire damage. Fortifying flames then dance around one creature of your choice within 30 feet of you. The chosen creature gains `1d6` temporary hit points.  
- **Lightning.** One of the targets of your choice takes an additional `1d6` lightning damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as residual lightning shocks its form.  

### Impeccable Physicality (Level 14)

*Level 14+ Mage of Prismari Feature*

Your relentless dedication and training have instilled an outstanding sense of precision and grace in your art. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws if you do not already have it. Additionally, when you make a Dexterity saving throw, you can treat a `d20` roll of a 9 or lower as a 10.
