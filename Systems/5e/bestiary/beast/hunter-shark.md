# Hunter Shark
*Source: Monster Manual p. 330, Princes of the Apocalypse, Storm King's Thunder, Tales from the Yawning Portal, Tomb of Annihilation, Ghosts of Saltmarsh, Dragon of Icespire Peak, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, Plane Shift: Ixalan, Sigil and the Outlands. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

Smaller than a giant shark but larger and fiercer than a reef shark, a hunter shark haunts deep waters. It usually hunts alone, but multiple hunter sharks might feed in the same area. A fully grown hunter shark is 15 to 20 feet long.
