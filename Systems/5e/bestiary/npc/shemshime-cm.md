## Traits

***Crushing End.*** If damage reduces Shemshime to 0 hit points, Shemshime instead drops to 1 hit point unless the damage is the result of Shemshime being crushed by an object weighing at least 1,000 pounds.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** Shemshime can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions

***Maddening Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`4d6 + 3`) psychic damage.

***Whispers of Violence.*** Shemshime chooses up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, or that target takes 7 (`1d8 + 3`) psychic damage and must use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack against one creature it can reach (Shemshime's choice) that Shemshime can see.

***Howling Babble (Recharge 6).*** Shemshime targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 21 (`4d8 + 3`) psychic damage and is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned).
