# Vulpin Noble
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Although founded by birdfolk, Alderheart is home to several noble families of influential humblefolk. Among them are vulpins, who find both their charms and wiles perfectly suited to the political intrigue of Alderheart's high society. Some vulpin nobles can trace their lineage back to ancient royalty.
