# Kalain

Kalain, was once a famous Waterdavian painter, but now Kalain's spirit is broken, leading to the onset of madness. She locks herself away, content to let time erode the last of her conscience.

## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** Kalain has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) and magic can't put her to sleep.

***Art Imitates Life (3/Day).*** Kalain touches one of her paintings and causes its subject to spring forth, becoming a creature of that kind provided its CR is 3 or lower. The creature appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the painting, which becomes blank. The creature is friendly toward Kalain and hostile toward all others. It rolls initiative to determine when it acts. It disappears after 1 minute, when it is reduced to 0 hit points, or when Kalain dies or falls [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

***Taunt (2/Day).*** Kalain can use a bonus action on her turn to target one creature within 30 feet of it. If the target can hear Kalain, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of Kalain's next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** Kalain is a 4th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma. She has the following bard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [friends](/Systems/5e/spells/friends.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [vicious mockery](/Systems/5e/spells/vicious-mockery.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [healing word](/Systems/5e/spells/healing-word.md), [heroism](/Systems/5e/spells/heroism.md), [sleep](/Systems/5e/spells/sleep.md), [thunderwave](/Systems/5e/spells/thunderwave.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md), [shatter](/Systems/5e/spells/shatter.md)
