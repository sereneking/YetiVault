| dice: d8 | Torment |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The Darklord's soul is so consumed by shadows that it extinguishes all light that shines on them. |
| 2 | The Darklord inherited unlimited wealth, but finery she wears turns to rags and food tastes like ash. |
| 3 | The Darklord is incomparably beautiful, but locals perceive him as a terrible beast. |
| 4 | Tattoos detailing the Darklord's sins cover their body. |
| 5 | Every night, the Darklord is the focus of a lavish ball, but during the day he turns into a lead statue. |
| 6 | A choir of spirits follows the Darklord, endlessly singing her sins. |
| 7 | The Darklord endlessly cries tears of blood, ink, poison, or molten iron. |
| 8 | The Darklord knows how he's going to die and sees evidence of impending doom everywhere. |
