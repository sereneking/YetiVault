| dice: d12 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The item bears the name or emblem of a lost troop of Akroan stratians (described in "chapter 3"). |
| 2 | The item is etched with a name or prayer written in Celestial (the language of the gods). |
| 3 | The item looks like it's been at the bottom of the sea for a hundred years but functions perfectly. |
| 4 | The item is wrapped in handwritten scrolls, suggesting it was once possessed by a founder of one of Meletis's philosophical schools (described in "chapter 3"). |

| 6 | A knotted cover or grip depicts colorful birds or stylized herd animals from the plains of Oreskos. |
| 7 | The item is at least partially made from the heartwood of a Setessan caryatid (described in "chapter 3"). The wood regularly sprouts fresh leaves, or its whorls suggest humanoid features. |

| 9 | The item is at least partially made of iron. |
| 10 | Whoever first touches the item receives an omen from the god who watches over it (see "chapter 4" for details on omens). |
