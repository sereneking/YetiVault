# Cornelius Watson
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy p. 30*  

Doc Watson (only his mother calls him Cornelius) is the consummate academic. He has an eclectic collection of interests and rarely stays focused on a single subject for longer than a few months. He calls himself a doctor, though strangely, medicine has never been one of his interests. Supposedly the term comes from his time with a man who claimed the highest accolade one could achieve in the study of a single subject was called a "doctorate". The one interest that Doc Watson has consistently kept up with is magic and that is mainly because it remains the best tool to help him continue to learn.

Doc Watson was born to a minor noble family in Waterdeep. While he was a studious child who loved reading, he was a little aimless and his family despaired of him finding a trade. Luckily, after spending time with his eccentric uncle (who happened to be a minor wizard), Doc Watson discovered that he had a knack for magic.

To the disappointment of his family, Doc Watson didn't apply this magical skill to a respectable profession such as the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors, the clergy of Mystra or the Academy of Stargazers. Instead, he tried his hand at an increasingly strange number of jobs, some of which his exasperated mother was certain he had invented entirely on his own. This included being a weather forecaster for the Waterdeep Port Authority and a columnist for the Weekly Waterdeep Gazette. The final straw was when Doc Watson tried his hand as an executive chef at the Inn of Barmy Blowhards. During his time there he claimed to have achieved the optimal Maillard reaction with a localized pyromance (getting the perfect sear on a steak using fire magic). It was at this point that his family cut off his monthly allowance.

Forced to find a new source of income, Doc Watson was convinced by a friend of his, Flimp Shagglecran, that he should try his hand at the age-old profession of adventuring. Adventuring turned out to be quite lucrative and exposed Doc Watson to all sorts of interesting people, places and monsters. Eventually, he and Flimp had accumulated enough wealth that they were able to found a new guild which they gave a descriptive, but exceedingly unoriginal, name: The Adventurer's Guild.
