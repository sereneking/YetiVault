# Shadowsteel Ghast

## Salvage

Taking 1 hour to extract the shards of Shadowsteel from a Shadowsteel ghoul, someone can collect an amount worth 250 gp. A Shadowsteel ghast yields a quantity worth 500 gp.

## Lore

- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** Those who use Shadowsteel to power curses can become Shadowsteel ghouls upon death. These undead creatures seek out more of the metal. As the creature ages, it can regain a semblance of the arcane power it had in life, empowering similar creatures and cursing nearby foes.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The Shadowsteel ghast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Shadowsteel Coat.*** The Shadowsteel ghast is coated in metal armor made of Shadowsteel.

***Shadowsteel Miasma.*** Creatures of the Shadowsteel ghast's choice that start their turn within 30 feet of the ghast must roll a `d4` and subtract the number rolled from any attack roll or saving throw they make until the start of their next turn. Only one miasma can affect a given creature at a time. A creature that rolls a natural 20 on any attack roll or saving throw while in a Shadowsteel miasma is immune to the miasma of any Shadowsteel ghast for 1 hour.

***Turning Defiance.*** The Shadowsteel ghast and any Shadowsteel ghouls within 30 feet of it have advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Shadowsteel ghast's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 13, `+5` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [chill touch](/Systems/5e/spells/chill-touch.md), [shocking grasp](/Systems/5e/spells/shocking-grasp.md) (both 17th level)

**2/day**: [bestow curse](/Systems/5e/spells/bestow-curse.md)

**3/day each**: [counterspell](/Systems/5e/spells/counterspell.md), [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md), [shield](/Systems/5e/spells/shield.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Shadowsteel ghast makes two claw attacks or casts one at-will spell and makes one claw attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) slashing damage and 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage. A cursed target must make an escalation check. If a target drops to 0 hit points due to this damage and isn't already cursed, they are randomly afflicted with one from among any of the curses in the Grim Hollow Campaign Guide (GM's choice).
