***Fey Ancestry.*** Alagarthas has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put him to sleep.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 bludgeoning damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, Alagarthas can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand him. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if Alagarthas is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).
