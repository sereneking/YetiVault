# Close Quarters Shooter
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Light, Dark, Underdark! p. 1*  

When making a ranged attack while you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature, you do not have disadvantage on the attack roll. Your ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover against targets within 30 feet of you. You have a +1 bonus to attack rolls on ranged attacks.
