# Warding Maneuver
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 3*  

If you or a creature within 5 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can expend one superiority die as a reaction if you're wielding a weapon or a shield. Roll the die, and add the number rolled to the target's AC against that attack. If the attack still hits, the target has resistance against the attack's damage.
