| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | The thrill of the hunt and of battle makes my blood burn and stokes the fire in my heart. A pity there are so few foes and so little prey worthy of me. |
| 2 | The worship of smaller creatures pleases me, though their weakness is patheticâ€”how can they do other than adore me? |
| 3 | Nothing is better than to sleep and dream upon my hoard with the warmth of a full belly. Let those who would disturb me beware! |
| 4 | Ah, if these foolish creatures only knew they were but pawns in the games I play to amuse myself. |
| 5 | I know that others seek to steal my treasures, my beautiful baubles, won through strength and cunning. But they are mine. Mine! |
| 6 | All that I survey, I could easily destroy. From time to time, it is important to remind these small creatures of the true extent of my power. |
| 7 | Although my power and life span are vast, they have merely whetted my appetite for immortality. |
| 8 | Heroes need foes to test them. Not all teachers can afford to be kind, and some lessons must be harsh. |
