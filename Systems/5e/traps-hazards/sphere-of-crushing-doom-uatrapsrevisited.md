# Sphere of Crushing Doom
*Generic Hazard*  

The court jester devised a deadly trap to foil anyone who sought to steal his magical fool's cap. The jester's tomb is located at the end of a 10-foot wide, 150-foot long hallway that runs northâ€“south with a sharp slope down. The entrance to the tomb is a door at the bottom of the slope at the southern end of the hall. A door on the eastern wall allows access to the tomb.
