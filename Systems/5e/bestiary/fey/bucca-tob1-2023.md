# Bucca
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 44*  

*These tiny, obsidian-skinned, bat-winged fey have a hungry look. Leering with razor-sharp fangs bared, they licking their leathery faces with their forked, purple tongues.*

## Hidden in Crevices

Buccas are tiny, underground faeries who are also known as "snatchers," because they love to steal from miners and hoard precious minerals and gems in tiny, trap‑filled crevices. Their small size makes them easy to overlook.

## Treasure Finders

Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.

## Bat Friends

Buccas often train bats as mounts, messengers, and guard animals. On occasion, they sell trained bats to goblins and kobolds.

## Traits

***Flyby.*** The bucca doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Sunlight Hypersensitivity.*** The bucca takes 1 radiant damage each minute it is exposed to sunlight. While in sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

***Treasure Sense.*** The bucca can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of it.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Invisibility.*** The bucca magically turns [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until it attacks, or until its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the bucca wears or carries is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with it.
