# Scion of Grolantor

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Grolantor is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Abundant Food.** Crops and domestic animals grow and reproduce quickly within 6 miles of the scion.  
- **Empowered Hill Giants.** Hill giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +7 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  
- **Farming Weather.** The weather within 6 miles of the scion is always ideal for farming: sunny and warm with occasional showers.  

If the scion dies, these effects end immediately.
