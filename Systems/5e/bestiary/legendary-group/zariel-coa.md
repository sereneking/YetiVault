# Zariel

## Regional effects
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

The region containing Zariel's lair is warped by her magic, which creates the following effect:

- **Hellscape.** The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.  

If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take one lair action to cause the following effect or one from the archdevil lair action list (page 214); she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Infernal Illusions.** Zariel casts the [Major Image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md) spell four times, targeting different areas with it. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or have the frightened condition for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The [Summoned Underlings](/Systems/5e/tables/archdevil-lair-action-list-summoned-underlings-coa.md) table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
