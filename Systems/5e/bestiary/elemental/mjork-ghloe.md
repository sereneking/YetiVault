## Salvage

Within every mjork is a heart of ash hardened into smoky crystal. This crystal might already be broken in the remains of a slain mjork, making it useless. An intact crystal can be broken or hurled at a point up to 60 feet away as an action. When it breaks, which it does upon landing if hurled, the crystal releases a 20-foot-radius sphere of sooty smoke, centered on a point in the breaker's space or on the point where the crystal landed. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute, but a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it in 4 rounds. A strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. These crystals sell for 15 gp or more each.

The smaller crystals from sootlings or broken mjork crystals are like smoky quartz. These gems can be worth from 1 sp to 1 gp each, or more to collectors who believe they are mjork crystals. Someone who polishes them using jeweler's tools can increase their value as semiprecious stones.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Mjorks are made from earth and fire clashing together. These elementals often dwell near volcanoes.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Mjorks are vulnerable to thunder damage, which cracks their rocky skin. They can also sense through smoke as if the haze provided them blindsight.
