**Ways to Read the Kill**

`dice: [](ways-to-read-the-kill-ai.md#^ways-to-read-the-kill)`

| dice: d6 | Reading |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Using a tiny bellows to pump one last breath into a corpse. |
| 2 | Reading the entrails with special reading-the-entrails glasses. |
| 3 | Burning a small piece of the body and looking for shapes in the smoke. |
| 4 | A cautious, reasoned, professional guesstimate. |
| 5 | Careful measurements. The distance between nostrils. The difference between the index finger and the middle finger. The elasticity of the ear lobe. |
| 6 | You take a long, careful look, and then decide based on which fellow franchisee has been nice to you lately. |
