# Mage of High Sorcery
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn Revisited p. 3*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)  
- **Languages.** Two of your choice  
- **Equipment.** A [bottle of colored ink](/Systems/5e/items/ink-1-ounce-bottle.md), an [ink pen](/Systems/5e/items/ink-pen.md), a set of [common clothes](/Systems/5e/items/common-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

Your talent for magic came to the attention of the Mages of High Sorcery, an organization of spellcasters that study magic and prevent its misuse. You've trained among the Mages, but whether or not you'll face the dangerous tests required to become a true member of the group remains to be determined. Your passion for studying magic has likely already predisposed you toward one of the organization's three orders: the benevolent Order of the White Robes, the balance-pursuing Order of the Red Robes, or the ruthless Order of the Black Robes.

In the world of Krynn, many refer to the Mages of High Sorcery as the Wizards of High Sorcery. The organization accepts more than wizards, though, with sorcerers, warlocks, and other spellcasters included among their ranks.

## Feature: Initiate of High Sorcery

You gain the [Initiate of High Sorcery](/Systems/5e/feats/initiate-of-high-sorcery-ua2022heroesofkrynnrevisited.md) feat.

In addition, the Mages of High Sorcery provide you with free, modest lodging and food indefinitely at any occupied Tower of High Sorcery and for one night at the home of an organization member.

## Building a Mage of High Sorcery Character

Mages of High Sorcery are typically sorcerers, warlocks, or wizards and might have any subclass. Spellcasters who gain their magic through devotion are less likely to be welcomed among the traditionalist mages. Nevertheless, the Mages of High Sorcery are shrewd, and they rarely let unique opportunities or individuals pass them by. Even members of martial classes who train in magic might find a rare place among the group's three orders.

### Suggested Characteristics

The study of magic drives the Mages of High Sorcery. Consider which of the group's three orders you aspire to join. The Mage of High Sorcery Personality Traits table suggests traits you might adopt for your character.

> [!note] Mages of Dragonlance
> 
> In past presentations of the Dragonlance setting, several of Dungeons & Dragon's modern spellcasting classes didn't exist. To accommodate these classes, the group known as the Wizards of High Sorcery has evolved into the Mages of High Sorcery. The group's distinct orders and signature robes remain, but the organization now accepts members from a broad range of spellcasting traditions.
