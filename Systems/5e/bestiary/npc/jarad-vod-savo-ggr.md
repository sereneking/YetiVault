# Jarad Vod Savo
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 235*  

The Golgari guildmaster is a Devkarin necromancer and lich named Jarad Vod Savo. In life, Jarad was an archer and accomplished hunter, as well as the brother of the previous guildmaster, the ambitious Savra. Jarad mastered the ways of necromancy so he could rise as a lich after he sacrificed himself to save his son from the demon Rakdos.

As head of the Golgari Swarm, Jarad commands elf and medusa assassins, legions of kraul, brutish trolls, and masses of undercity-dwelling creatures. Thanks to the necromantic power he wields-and with the support of his loyal guards and soldiers-he has survived a number of assassination attempts from various upstarts.

## Undead Nature

Jarad doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Jarad fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Jarad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Jarad regains 25 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes fire or radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. He dies only if he starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spore Infusion.*** Jarad is surrounded by a cloud of spores. As a bonus action, he can cause the spores to deal 11 (`2d10`) poison damage to a creature he can see within 10 feet of him.

***Turn Resistance.*** Jarad has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces Jarad to 0 hit points, he must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, he drops to 1 hit point instead.
