# Likho
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 254*  

*This goblin-like creature bears one large, strange eye in the middle of its face. It wears dark and dirty rags, and its spindly claws and arms match its hunched torso.*

## Ferocious Attitude

Likhos are scrappy fighters. They weaken foes from afar with their magical gaze, then rush forward, shredding the victims with their claws. Once a likho has leapt onto a creature, it shreds flesh using the claws on both its hands and feet.

## Jeers and Insults

A likho uses its limited telepathy to taunt and jeer at its target from a distance during the hunt. A likho enjoys stalking intelligent humanoids and tormenting them from hiding until discovered or when it grows tired of the hunt.

## Organ Eaters

Likhos thrive when they drain away luck and aptitude. Once the likho immobilizes a creature, it gnaws at the creature's abdomen with its jagged teeth, devouring the organs of its still-living prey. A likho consumes only a humanoid's organs and leaves the rest of the body behind.

## Traits

***Limited Telepathy.*** The likho can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.

***Pounce.*** If the likho moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the target is [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), the likho can make one Claw attack against it as a bonus action.

***Magic Resistance.*** The likho has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The likho can use its Disruptive Gaze. It then makes four Claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Disruptive Gaze.*** One creature the likho can see within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn.
