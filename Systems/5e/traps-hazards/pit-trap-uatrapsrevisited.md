# Pit Trap
*Generic Hazard*  

This trap consists of a 10-foot deep pit, concealed by a tattered canvass covered with leaves and dirt. This type of trap is useful for blocking off the entrance to a monster lair and usually has narrow, safe ledges along its sides. Trigger. Anyone stepping on the canvass might fall into the pit.
