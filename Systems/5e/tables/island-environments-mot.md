**Island Environments**

`dice: [](island-environments-mot.md#^island-environments)`

| dice: d10 | Environment |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | Frozen. The island is magically frozen or is a floating iceberg. Perhaps something lies locked within. |
| 2 | Sargassum. The island is a dense layer of seaweed that has developed its own ecosystem of strange beasts and trapped sailors. |
| 3 | Living. The island is actually a gigantic slumbering creature—potentially unbeknown to its residents. |
| 4 | Mirage. Magical phenomena surround a mundane island with tempting or treacherous illusions. |
| 5 | Nyx Shard. The island is a manifestation of Nyx, a recreation of a land from the distant past or completely from fiction. |
| 6 | Idyllic. The island has beautiful weather and abundant fruit—so much so that some might consider never leaving. |
| 7 | Lost Ruin. The island is all that survived a calamity that destroyed a legendary city. |
| 8 | Gateway. The island is inherently magical, perhaps being an intrusion from a bizarre demiplane or the dream of a sleeping demigod. |
| 9 | Promised Land. The island is a gift from a god to a favored individual or population, specially tailored to suit their whims. |
| 10 | Divine Refuge. A god created this island to be a personal getaway, making it a reflection of the world as it would appear if they were in complete control. |
