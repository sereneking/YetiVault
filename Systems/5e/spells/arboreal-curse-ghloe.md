# Arboreal Curse
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*7th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a cup of sap
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into wood. If the target's body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) as its flesh begins to harden into bark. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected.

A creature [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails its Constitution saving throw three times, it is turned into a tree and subjected to the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition for the duration. The successes and failures don't need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.

If the transformed creature is burned, chopped down, or otherwise destroyed while [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified), the creature is slain.

A creature remains transformed unless the effect is reversed within one year with [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md), [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md), or similar magical effects. If the creature spends one year and a day as a tree, the transformation becomes permanent, and nothing can return the creature to its original form.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md)
