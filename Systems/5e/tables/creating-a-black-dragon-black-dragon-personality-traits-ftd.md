**Black Dragon Personality Traits**

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I demonstrate my brilliance through the cruel subtlety of my actions. |
| 2 | Watching the works of lesser beings crumble and fall into ruin fills me with joy. |
| 3 | I never confront a threat directly when deceit and skulduggery are available options. |
| 4 | Subjugating others is preferable to destroying them. Thralls make life so much more pleasant. |
| 5 | I will go to great lengths to obtain deadly new magical knowledge. |
| 6 | Nothing lasts forever. But I promise to outlast you. |
| 7 | I have witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations. What consideration does a creature as pitiful and short-lived as you deserve? |
| 8 | Collecting antiquities and learning why lost cultures vanished are my reasons for existing. If you can help me in that, I'll let you live. |
