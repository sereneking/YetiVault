# Northedge Quarter: Important Districts
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 163* 

| District | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Crystal Bridge | A peaceful residential district with many wealthy and aristocratic estates. | Upper Northedge |
| Oak Towers | A residential district where housing ranges from comfortable to aristocratic. Construction in Oak Towers uses materials and styles drawn from Aerenal, and the district is home to many of Sharn's established elf and half-elf families. | Upper Northedge |
| Shae Lias | This district is a bastion for the culture and traditions of the elves of Aerenal. It includes a variety of businesses specializing in Aereni goods, as well as a temple of the Undying Court. | Upper Northedge |
| High Hope | A center for worship for the people of Northedge, High Hope includes temples of the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host, along with many smaller shrines. It lacks the grandeur of Sovereign Towers in Central Plateau, but has an atmosphere of solemn devotion. | Middle Northedge |
| Holdfast | Holdfast is the heart of Sharn's native dwarf population. The ancestors of the Holdfast dwarves helped build Sharn, and many of its people are stonemasons, architects, and smiths. Holdfast dwarves are proud of their Sharn roots and have little interest in Mror customs or traditions. | Middle Northedge |
| Longstairs | The population of this peaceful residential district is mostly made up of dwarves, humans, and half-elves. Neighbors here generally stand together to deal with any trouble. | Lower Northedge |
| North Market | The open market in this region largely deals in simple, locally produced goods. Due to the significant shifter population in Lower Northedge, North Market offers goods and services aimed at shifters (grooming services, claw care, and so forth) as well as those reflecting an Eldeen influence. | Lower Northedge |
| Stoneyard | This residential district is home to the majority of Sharn's shifters, including both recent immigrants from the Eldeen Reaches and long-established local families. The district includes a makeshift hrazhak court and a shrine devoted to the Wardens of the Wood. Conditions are poor to modest. | Lower Northedge |
