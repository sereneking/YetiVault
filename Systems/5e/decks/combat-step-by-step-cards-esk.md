### Combat Step by Step

- **Determine surprise.** The DM determines whether anyone involved in the combat encounter is [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised).  
- **Establish positions.** The DM decides where all the characters and monsters are located. Given the character's marching order and their stated positions, the DM figures out where the adversaries areâ€”how far away and in what direction.  
- **Roll initiative.** Everyone involved rolls initiative, determining the order of combatants' turns.  
- **Take turns.** Each participant in the combat takes a turn in the initiative order.  
- **Begin the next round.** When every participant in the combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 4 until the fighting stops.
