**Xaos Adventures**

`dice: [](xaos-adventures-sato.md#^xaos-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A team of four [quadrones](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/quadrone.md) recruits the party on a rescue mission into the "Cube". |
| 2 | Lazethon, a [githzerai uniter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-uniter-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"), recruits the characters to defend the embassy from an approaching githyanki warship. |
| 3 | A merciless [githyanki knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-knight.md) arrives in Xaos on the back of a [young red dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-red-dragon.md). He asks the characters to help him sniff out members of the Sha'sal Khou on behalf of Vlaakith the Lich-Queen. |
| 4 | Slaadi flock to their nest in Xaos for a ritual that occurs once every century. Afraid of becoming hosts for [slaad tadpoles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole.md), townsfolk beseech the characters for aid. |
