# Nightbringer
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d6 B
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This heavy mace has a dark oaken handle and a head of blackened steel trimmed with gold. In combat, the mace's head is wreathed in inky black energy.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an additional `4d4` radiant damage.

If you have an evil alignment, you also gain the following benefits when attuned to Nightbringer:

## Blessing of the Dragon Queen

You are immune to the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) and [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) conditions, and you gain immunity to one of the following damage types (choose when you attune to the weapon): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

## Eyes of Midnight

You have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision), its range increases by 60 feet.

## Midnight Shroud

The weapon has 6 charges. When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can expend one charge to force the creature to make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of your next turn. The weapon regains `1d6` expended charges daily at dawn.
