| dice: d6 | Setting |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A countryside with stretches of hayfields, colorful barns, and perpetually smiling residents |
| 2 | An island floating in the air where ground-worshipers dream of the lands below |
| 3 | A telepathic collective that townsfolk join by ingesting a rare fungus |
| 4 | Tunnels where sewer dwellers assure that the "blood of the city" ever flows |
| 5 | A glacier that residents never leave, lest the icy spirits haunting their community escape |
| 6 | Rival villages engaged in a private, age-old war |
