# Shroud of Ulban
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 18th-level, "The Great Old One" Patron

The blue-white star Ulban maintains a fickle presence among the stars, fluttering into view only to herald a dire omen. As an action, you can turn [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) for 1 minute. If you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw, you become visible at the end of the current turn.
