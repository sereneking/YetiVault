# Shield Training
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 3*  

You've trained in the effective use of shields. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with [shields](/Systems/5e/items/shield.md).  
- In combat, you can don or doff a shield as the free object interaction on your turn.  
- If you have the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature, you can use a shield as a spellcasting focus.
