# Neogi Hatchling Swarm
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 40*  

A neogi lives about a century. When an individual is rendered weak by advanced age, the other neogi in the group overpower it and inject it with a special poison. The toxin transforms the old neogi into a bloated mass of flesh. Younger neogi lay their eggs atop it, and when the hatchlings emerge, they devour the old neogi and one another until only a few of the strongest newborns are left. Sometimes the newborns, united by a singular evil purpose, coalesce into a skittering swarm instead.

## Traits

***Spider Climb.*** The swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny neogi hatchling. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Swarm of Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 22 (`6d6 + 1`) poison damage, or 11 (`3d6 + 1`) poison damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
