**Suggested Ideals**

`dice: [](brazen-coalition-suggested-ideals-psx.md#^suggested-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Wealth.** Money can buy anything. |
| 2 | **Freedom.** The sea is the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. |
| 3 | **Knowledge.** I'm as greedy for secrets and lore as others are for treasure. |
| 4 | **Pillage.** It's not the having, it's the taking that shows who's strongest. |
| 5 | **Crew.** I'm committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. |
| 6 | **Coalition.** I believe we're not just stronger but also better when we join forces in unity. |
