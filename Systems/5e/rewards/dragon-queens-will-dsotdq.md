# Dragon Queen's Will
*Charm*  

You've seen a glimpse of the Dragon Queen's ambitions. It haunts your dreams but steels your will to oppose her. This charm grants you a +4 bonus on Wisdom saving throws. Once used three times, the charm vanishes. While you have this charm, you suffer unsettling but harmless dreams of ravenous dragons. You also permanently gain the ability to speak Draconic if you couldn't already.
