# Vulpin Priest of Kren
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Priests of the Amaranthine Kren tend shrines in her honor, and share stories of her guile and cunning with visitors. These tales emphasize humility, wariness, and teach listeners to keep their wits about them at all times. In rare cases, these priests are given divine gifts by their Amaranthine. Conferred a portion of Kren's supernatural slyness, they often seek to humble those who have grown too proud.
