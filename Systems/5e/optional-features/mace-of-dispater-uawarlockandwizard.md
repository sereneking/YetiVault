# Mace of Dispater
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade, "The Fiend" Patron

When you create your pact weapon as a mace, it manifests as an iron mace forged in Dis, the second of the Nine Hells. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional `2d8` force damage to the target per spell level, and you can knock the target [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) if it is Huge or smaller.
