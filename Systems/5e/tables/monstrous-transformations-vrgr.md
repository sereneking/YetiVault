**Monstrous Transformations**

`dice: [](monstrous-transformations-vrgr.md#^monstrous-transformations)`

| dice: d10 | Transformation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | The Darklord loses their voice; their words now carve themselves on their skin as lingering scars. |
| 2 | Something the Darklord stole or used in a terrible crime becomes part of their bodyâ€”perhaps a sizable jewel, emblem of rulership, or suit of armor. |
| 3 | The Darklord's eyes distend from their sockets like a slug's tentacles, in the mouths of serpents, or on metallic cables. |
| 4 | The Darklord's most painful memories visually repeat in reflections around them or amid illusory projections. |
| 5 | The Darklord gains an idealized form, though it's made of an inorganic material or others react as if it were terrifying. |
| 6 | The Darklord's body disintegrates, leaving only an animate heart, hand, gory ooze, or nervous system that must attach to new, temporary bodies. |
| 7 | Clouds of incense, insects, poison gas, or smoke leak from the Darklord's mouth, fingers, or pores. |
| 8 | The Darklord appears as someone they wronged, and their true appearance is revealed at particular hours, in reflections, or under certain lights. |
| 9 | The Darklord splits into multiple creatures, each representing them at a different time in their life. |
| 10 | The Darklord retains their memories and intellect but is otherwise any monster from "chapter 5" or the "Monster Manual". |
