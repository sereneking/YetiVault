**Zil Schemes**

`dice: [](gnomes-of-zilargo-zil-schemes-erlw.md#^zil-schemes)`

| dice: d10 | Scheme |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Your family is working on a new form of elemental binding, but they need a lot of Khyber dragonshards. |
| 2 | You have an anonymous contact who sends you missions via the [sending](/Systems/5e/spells/sending.md) spell. When you do as you're asked, you receive handsome rewards. |
| 3 | You've inherited a plot of land in Q'barra. If you don't visit within a year, you'll lose the claim. |
| 4 | Due to an unusual twist of Triumvirate law, you share the same name with a number of other Zil, and you're all legally considered to be the same person. |
| 5 | You've acquired a [spellshard](/Systems/5e/items/spellshard-erlw.md) (described in "chapter 5") that contains a vast amount of text in a strange code. |
| 6 | You know the location of a wanted war criminal, and you've been trying to decide whether to turn them in or try to get something in exchange for your silence. |
| 7 | You've been selling false treasure maps, but now you've found one that might be real. |
| 8 | You've acquired a controlling stake in a dragonshard mine, which was abandoned long ago. But why? Kobolds? Aberrations? There's only one way to find out! |
| 9 | Your family is facing financial ruin, and they've taken out a life insurance policy on you. It only pays out if you die under unusual circumstances, and they're encouraging you to seek out more dangerous adventures. |
| 10 | You're peddling a life-extension scheme where clients are [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) by a medusa and then restored later. |
