# Ancient Time Dragon
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 48, Sigil and the Outlands, Turn of Fortune's Wheel*  

These sleek dragons harness the power of time to manipulate the past, present, and future. Time dragon wyrmlings are born with shining scales and have horns that are barely more than nubs. As they master the flow of time, their horns grow with branching, rainbow-hued veins suggestive of time's paths and possibilities.

Ancient time dragons can create temporal gates connected to specific times and places in the multiverse. Using these, they and allied creatures can travel anywhere in time to affect fate-determining moments or to banish threats beyond the flow of time. As a result of their ability to travel between ages, time dragons often seem unstuck from the usual flow of time and have a flexible view of what is, what was, and what will be.

Time dragons prize historical records, objects representative of lost cultures, and treasures from long-gone creators. They are fascinated by time-manipulation magic and forgotten knowledge. Those who stumble upon a time dragon's hoard might find invaluable historical information from eras past.

## A Time Dragon's Lair

Time dragons often lair in the ruins of ancient civilizations or temples to dead gods and do their utmost to preserve these historical sites. A time dragon's insatiable desire for knowledge means it's likely to have more than one such lair.

The challenge rating of an ancient or adult time dragon increases by 1 when it's encountered in its lair.

## Traits

***Cycle of Rebirth.*** If the dragon dies, its soul coalesces into a steely egg and teleports to a random plane of existence. The egg is immune to all damage and hatches into a time dragon wyrmling after `1d100` years. The dragon retains all memories and knowledge it gained in its previous life.

***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks.

***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+17` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d8 + 9`) slashing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) force damage.

***Time Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales a wave of shimmering light in a 90-foot cone. Nonmagical objects and vegetation in that area that aren't being worn or carried crumble to dust. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 52 (`8d12`) force damage and is magically weakened as it is desynchronized from the time stream. While the creature is in this state, attack rolls against it have advantage, it has the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition, and other creatures have resistance to all damage it deals. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only. A weakened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself after it succeeds on three of these saves.

***Time Gate (1/Day).*** The dragon conjures a 20-foot-diameter, circular portal in the space between its horns or in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of itself. The portal links to a precise location on any plane of existence at a point in time up to 8,000 years from the present, whether past or future. The portal lasts for 24 hours or until the dragon's [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is transported to the destination, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by the dragon from opening in the rulers' presence or anywhere within their domains.

## Reactions

The dragon can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.

***Reactive Rend.*** After using Legendary Resistance or in response to being hit by an attack roll, the dragon makes one Rend attack.

***Slow Time.*** Immediately after a creature the dragon can see ends its turn, the dragon targets a creature it can see within 90 feet of itself that is weakened by its Time Breath. Until the weakened effect ends on the target, its speed becomes 0, and its speed can't increase.

***Time Slip.*** The dragon halves the damage it takes from an attack made against it, provided it can see the attacker. The dragon can then immediately teleport, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
