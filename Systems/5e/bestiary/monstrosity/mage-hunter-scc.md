# Mage Hunter
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 199*  

Mage hunters are hideous spider-legged creatures employed by the Oriq to pursue magic-wielders. These creatures can naturally sense magic via the glowing purple spines on their backs.

A mage hunter is usually in its sentry form, a diamond-shaped drone with a heightened ability to sense and locate mages. Once it finds a quarry, the mage hunter takes on its arachnoid hunter form and pursues its targets with vicious skill.

## Traits

***Magic Sense.*** The hunter knows the location of every spellcaster, active spell, and magic item within 120 feet of itself.

***Spider Climb (Hunter Form Only).*** The hunter can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack (Hunter Form Only).*** The hunter makes two Claw attacks.

***Claw (Hunter Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`4d8 + 4`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the hunter can't make a Tail attack against another target.

***Mage Tracker (Sentry Form Only).*** The hunter emits a pulse of energy that helps it better locate its magical quarry. Each creature within 120 feet of the hunter that has the ability to cast spells must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be mystically marked by the hunter for 1 hour.

While marked, a creature can't become hidden from the hunter and gains no benefit from the [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) condition against the hunter. Additionally, while a marked creature is on the same plane of existence as the hunter, the hunter always knows the distance and direction to the creature.

## Bonus Actions

***Shift Form.*** The hunter folds into its drone-like sentry form or unfolds into its hunter form. Its game statistics are the same in each form.

## Reactions

***Consume and Destroy.*** When the hunter takes damage from a spell, it takes only half the triggering damage (rounded down). If the creature that cast the spell is within 60 feet of the hunter, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take the other half of the damage.
