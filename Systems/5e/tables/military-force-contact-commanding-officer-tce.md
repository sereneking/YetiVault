**Commanding Officer**

`dice: [](military-force-contact-commanding-officer-tce.md#^commanding-officer)`

| dice: d6 | Officer |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Tested Veteran**. Your commander is a battle-scarred officer who experienced horrors in combat. They rely on something to dull the pain of their memories or wounds, from a favorite writer's prose to a distracting vice. |
| 2 | **Taskmaster**. This angry officer yells every order, reprimands you for the smallest mistake, and fully expects you to fail at every mission you undertake. This might be tough love or simple brutishness. |
| 3 | **Protective Officer**. A kindly officer is hesitant to send you into danger and constantly reminds you to be careful. |
| 4 | **Bitter Soldier**. Your commander carries deep grudges against your force's enemies. They leap at any chance to do those foes harm, even if it puts your group in terrible risk. |
| 5 | **Hopeful Commander**. This optimistic officer knows that a new era of peace is just over the horizon. You just need to complete these last few missions, then it should all finally be over. |
| 6 | **Devout Leader**. Your commander is a person of deep faith. They believe that your success or failure lies entirely in divine hands and you are the instruments of that will. |
