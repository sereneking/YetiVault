# Runara
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 40*  

Despite her innocuous disguise and her commitment to peace, the leader of Dragon's Rest is an adult bronze dragonâ€”a fearsome opponent or a powerful ally. Her capabilities go beyond what is presented here.

## Bronze Dragons

Many bronze dragons are friendly coastal dwellers who enjoy watching ships and sailors.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Runara can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Runara fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Runara can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d10 + 7`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d6 + 7`) slashing damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Runara's choice that is within 120 feet of Runara and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Runara's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Breath Weapons (Recharge 5-6).*** Runara uses one of the following breath weapons.

- **Lightning Breath.** Runara exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (`12d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Repulsion Breath.** Runara exhales repulsion energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60 feet away from Runara.  

***Change Shape.*** Runara magically transforms into a Humanoid or Beast that is Medium or Small, while retaining her game statistics (other than her size). This transformation ends if Runara is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
