# Troglodyte Champion of Laogzed
*Source: Out of the Abyss p. 229*  

The Monster Manual provides statistics for the typical troglodyte. Once in a while, a troglodyte tribe produces an unusually smart and strong specimen that can spew acid-what many troglodytes consider blessings from Laogzed, their demonic god. These hulking troglodyte champions make excellent chieftains.

## Traits

***Chameleon Skin.*** The troglodyte has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.

***Stench.*** Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 feet of the troglodyte must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the troglodyte has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The troglodyte makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with either its claws or its greatclub.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Acid Spray (Recharge 6).*** The troglodyte spits acid in a line 15 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
