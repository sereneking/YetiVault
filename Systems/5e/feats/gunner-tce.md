You have a quick hand and keen eye when employing firearms, granting you the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with firearms (see "[Firearms](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/firearms.md)" in the Dungeon Master's Guide).  
- You ignore the loading property of firearms.  
- Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls.
