| 2 | **Greater Threat**. The characters are fighting each other when a rampaging wurm attacks. |
| 3 | **Sudden Danger**. The characters are trapped together by a sinkhole opening, a building collapsing, or a laboratory exploding. |
| 4 | **Dream Team**. A strange dream leads each character to the same destination. |
| 5 | **Lost Together**. The characters are hopelessly lost in an unfamiliar part of the city. |
| 6 | **Detente**. By order of their guilds' leaders, the characters must cooperate to complete a secret mission. |
| 7 | **Common Foe**. A villain is a common enemy to all the characters. |
