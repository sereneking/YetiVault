## Traits

***Indomitable (2/Day).*** Portia rerolls a failed saving throw.

***Second Wind (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, Portia can regain 20 hit points.

***Shadowfell Despair.*** Portia suffers from Shadowfell despair manifesting as unshakable dread. Until the despair ends, she has disadvantage on all saving throws and gains the following flaw: "I'm convinced that I'm going to die in Vanrakdoom." Portia can attempt to end her despair each time she finishes a long rest, doing so with a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. A [calm emotions](/Systems/5e/spells/calm-emotions.md) spell also ends her despair, as does any spell or other magical effect that removes a curse.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage, plus 7 (`2d6`) slashing damage if Portia has more than half of its total hit points remaining.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, plus 7 (`2d6`) piercing damage if Portia has more than half of its total hit points remaining.
