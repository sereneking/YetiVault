Many who succumb to contamination become grotesque mockeries of their former selves. They suffer a wretched and loathsome fate, aimlessly wandering the ruins following half-forgotten memories. Most are gripped by despair, fear, and madness which drive them to act violently, though a rare few experience lucidity and a gruesome awareness of their miserable state. Their distorted and emaciated bodies are sustained by the magic of the Haze.
