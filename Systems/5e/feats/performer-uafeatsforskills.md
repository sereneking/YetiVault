# Performer
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 3*  

You master performance so that you can command any stage. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- While performing, you can try to distract one humanoid you can see who can see and hear you. Make a Charisma ([Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance)) check contested by the humanoid's Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If your check succeeds, you grab the humanoid's attention enough that it makes Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks with disadvantage until you stop performing.
