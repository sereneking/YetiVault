| dice: d6 | Reason for Independence |
|----------|-------------------------|
| 1 | I've been around long enough that my guild lets me do what I want. |
| 2 | I've been chosen for special assignments because I'm just that good. |
| 3 | I've been singled out for special assignments because somebody up the ranks hates me. |
| 4 | I'm moonlighting, and I'd get in trouble if my superiors knew what I was up to. |
| 5 | I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors want to help them. |
| 6 | I've been put at the disposal of another guild because my superiors hope I'll fail. |
