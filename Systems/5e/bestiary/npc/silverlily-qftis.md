## Traits

***Charge.*** If Silverlily moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (`2d8`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Magic Resistance.*** Silverlily has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Silverlily's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Silverlily's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). Silverlily can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md)

**1/day each**: [calm emotions](/Systems/5e/spells/calm-emotions.md), [dispel evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [entangle](/Systems/5e/spells/entangle.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Silverlily makes two attacks: one with its hooves and one with its horn.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Horn.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Healing Touch (3/Day).*** Silverlily touches another creature with its horn. The target magically regains 11 (`2d8 + 2`) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

***Teleport (1/Day).*** Silverlily magically teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location Silverlily is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.

## Legendary Actions
