| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A Gatekeeper druid wants a rock sample from the Glass Plateau. |
| 2 | A magewright from House Cannith wants the party to escort him to a "warforged colossus". The magewright wants to retrieve the docent network from the colossus before an unscrupulous House Phiarlan operative does so. |
| 3 | On her deathbed, the visionary artist who designed the lightning rail station at Metrol reveals that she hid a treasure map within a lamp in her old office. |
| 4 | A wealthy eccentric asks the party to go into the Mournland and retrieve his most prized possession (a letter from a lover, a mechanical caterpillar, or anything else you devise) from his mansion. |
| 5 | A young Cyran paladin is morose because she was away from Cyre on a mission when the Day of Mourning occurred and never got to say goodbye to her family. She longs to retrieve her father's sword. |
| 6 | An elderly knight is strapping on his armor one last time so he can ride into the Mournland and die on the battlefield where his companions perished and "where I should have been." |
