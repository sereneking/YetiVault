## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Ker-arach has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spider Climb.*** Ker-arach can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** Ker-arach ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Ker-arach makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d10 + 5`) piercing damage plus 13 (`2d12`) poison damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Spiderling Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Ker-arach exhales venomous spiderlings in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (`6d10`) piercing damage and 33 (`6d10`) poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bonus Actions

***Stifling Webs (Recharge 5-6).*** Ker-arach spins a 30-foot cube of strong, sticky webbing in an area adjacent to itself. The webbing lasts for 1 minute, is difficult terrain, and lightly obscures its area. A creature that starts its turn in the webbing or enters the webbing for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition while in the web. As an action, a creature can free itself or another creature from the web by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.

A 5-foot cube of the web is destroyed if it takes at least 10 acid, fire, or slashing damage on a single turn.
