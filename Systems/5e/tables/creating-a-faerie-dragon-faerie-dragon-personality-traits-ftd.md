| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Some people say I have a short attention span, and that I'm easily distractable, but they don't... oh wow, is that a lute? |
| 2 | I do not constantly steal food. If you can't keep track of your rations, that's really a personal failing. |
| 3 | I'm much smarter than I look, and if you can't say the same, this is going to be a short conversation. |
| 4 | Elf, dwarf, horseâ€”you non-dragons all look the same to me. No offense. |
| 5 | When I narrate what I'm doing in song, it makes everything feel more epic, don't you think? |
| 6 | The world is a product of my imagination. The fact that you think you exist when I'm not thinking about you is adorable. |
| 7 | I'm quick to make friends and love winning over grumpy and stoic types. If they don't yet appreciate my help, that just means they need more of it! |
| 8 | I like to earn people's trust, then lead them into dangerous situations and make off with their treasure while they're distracted. |
