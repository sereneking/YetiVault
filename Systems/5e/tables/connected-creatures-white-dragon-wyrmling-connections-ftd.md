**White Dragon Wyrmling Connections**

`dice: [](connected-creatures-white-dragon-wyrmling-connections-ftd.md#^white-dragon-wyrmling-connections)`

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A pair of [ice mephits](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/ice-mephit.md) delight in chasing townsfolk into a [white dragon wyrmling's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) lair to be eaten. |
| 2 | A brooding [griffon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) found a dragon egg and cared for it along with her own brood. Though the [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) ate the griffon's other hatchlings, the griffon treats the wyrmling as her offspring and protects the creature fiercely. |
| 3 | A clan of warriors has adopted a [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) as the clan's sacred guardian and brings the wyrmling captured foes as offerings. |
| 4 | [Yetis](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/yeti.md) keep a [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) chained near the entrance of their lair to discourage scavengers. |
| 5 | A well-meaning [druid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) is trying to rear a [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) as a guardian of nature, training the dragon to hunt only Monstrosities. But the wyrmling keeps attacking other creatures. |
| 6 | A band of [ogres](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) keeps a [white dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/white-dragon-wyrmling.md) caged near their larder, as they have discovered that the dragon's cold breath keeps their meat fresh. |
