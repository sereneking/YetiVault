# Moon Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  


As an action, you can speak a command word while touching this card and transform into a wolflike biped for 1 minute. For that duration, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and when you hit a target with a weapon or an unarmed strike, the target takes an extra `1d6` force damage. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
