## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If Shemeshka fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Shemeshka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Special Equipment.*** Shemeshka carries a magic crown called the Razorvine Tiara. In the hands of anyone other than Shemeshka, the Razorvine Tiara functions as a [tentacle rod](/Systems/5e/items/tentacle-rod.md) that deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

***Spellcasting.*** Shemeshka casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will**: [alter self](/Systems/5e/spells/alter-self.md), [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md)

**1/day each**: [banishment](/Systems/5e/spells/banishment.md), [contact other plane](/Systems/5e/spells/contact-other-plane.md) (as an action), [mind blank](/Systems/5e/spells/mind-blank.md)

**2/day each**: [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Shemeshka uses Arcane Flux or Spellcasting. She then makes one Claw attack or one attack with her Razorvine Tiara.

***Arcane Flux.*** Shemeshka causes a surge of arcane energy to burst around one creature she can see within 120 feet of herself. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 45 (`7d12`) force damage and has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d4 + 5`) slashing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage.

***Razorvine Tiara.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`3d6`) slashing damage plus 9 (`2d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or its speed is halved and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the end of its next turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Teleport.*** Shemeshka teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see.

## Reactions

***Fell Counterspell (3/Day).*** Shemeshka utters a magical word to interrupt a creature she can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 5th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 6th level or higher, Shemeshka makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster gains the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition until the end of its next turn.
