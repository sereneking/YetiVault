## Salvage

The reaction of most folks who have encountered a horror flit is, "Burn it with fire!" But a handful of naturalists seek out these creatures for a variety of purposes, paying handsomely for samples. Bounties for these creatures in urban areas range from 10 to 100 gp.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** A horror flit has no eyes, but they sense their prey by means of vibrations in the air or in the water. They breed by infesting the flesh of their prey.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** The largest of these creatures, called "breeders" by most, can spit out swarms of their young, especially when the breeder instinctively feels it might die. The creature normally reproduces more slowly, vomiting a new swarm every few days.
