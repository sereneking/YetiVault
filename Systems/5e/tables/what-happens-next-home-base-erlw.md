| dice: d12 | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | The Drunken Dragon (Clifftop, Upper Dura) is a tavern frequented by members of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. It has a wide selection of spirits, and its walls are covered with adventuring trophies. The owner, a middle-aged halfling named Hascal d'Ghallanda, is a former adventurer who lost an eye and a leg in Xen'drik; he always has a story to share. |
| 2 | The Anvil (Callestan, Lower Dura) was one of the first Ghallanda halls in Sharn. Its glory days are long past, but the young innkeeper, Eranna d'Ghallanda, is determined to keep it alive. The Anvil is frequented by members of the Boromar Clan and is a good choice if one of the player characters has ties to this group. |
| 3 | The Dezina Museum of Antiquities (University, Upper Menthis) is attached to the library of Morgrave University. The museum has a remarkable collection of relics, but it's always looking for more. The curator is an elf named Emeron Sennared. He might be a personal friend or former teacher of one of the adventurers, or simply one who indulges their enthusiasm for antiquities and exotic locations. |
| 4 | Coldflame Keep (High Hope, Middle Northedge) is a garrison church dedicated to the Silver Flame. Once it supported a troop of templars, but it was largely abandoned during the war and now maintains a minimal staff. The priest, Mazin Tana, is a faithful servant of the Silver Flame and will provide modest food and lodging to adventurers who are trying to make the city a better place. |
| 5 | The Red Hammer (Blackbones, the Cogs) caters to warforged. It is run by two warforged, the envoy Blue and a juggernaut named Crucible. Although this place is a haven for warforged, other humanoids are allowed inside if their warforged allies vouch for them. |
| 6 | A Gold Dragon Inn (described earlier in this chapter) operated by House Ghallanda and located in almost any part of Sharn. |
| 7 | The district of Fallen (Lower Dura) was abandoned after a floating tower fell on it. The adventurers might have taken over an old temple or tavern on the edge of the district. |
| 8 | An abandoned bell tower, which could be anywhere in the city. The spells that drove the massive mechanism failed long ago. |
| 9 | An abandoned library, damaged during the war or thought to be cursed or haunted. |
| 10 | A shuttered tavern, which is a failed business tied to the family of one of the adventurers. |
| 11 | If one of the adventurers is a noble, the characters' base of operations is in the basement of the family estate or a tower apartment owned (but not currently used) by a dotty old aunt. |
| 12 | A ramshackle skycoach tethered to a condemned tower on the edge of the city. |
