**Why Be an Occultant?**

`dice: [](why-be-an-occultant-ai.md#^why-be-an-occultant)`

| dice: d8 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You believe in karmic balance, but hate the idea that "balance" means good and bad things can both happen to you. Good things happening to you and bad things happening to other people seems perfectly reasonable. |
| 2 | You love drinking tea and hate cleaning up, so pretending that the dregs in those dozens of empty cups are there to show ill omens and portents is a perfect cover. |
| 3 | You collected beads carved as skulls as a child. Nobody ever told you there was a career in that sort of thing. |
| 4 | You watched someone close to you die, and were overcome by the feeling that you should be making money off it somehow. |
| 5 | You've always owned a stuffed cat. You're not sure where it came from, but it's given you great career advice so far. |
| 6 | You've always worn a lot of black. |
| 7 | You really wanted a job where you can hide a fog machine under the desk for dramatic effect during meetings. |
| 8 | You have an obsession with death that clearly marks you for great things. |
