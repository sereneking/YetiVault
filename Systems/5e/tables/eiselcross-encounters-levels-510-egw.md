`dice: [](eiselcross-encounters-levels-510-egw.md#^eiselcross-encounters-levels-510)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters encounter `1d4 + 1` [mammoths](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md) being hunted by `2d6` wildfolk [scouts](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/scout.md). |
| 2 | An [abominable yeti](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/abominable-yeti.md) and `1d4` [yetis](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/yeti.md) stalk the characters. |
| 3 | The characters encounter `2d4` [yetis from Allowak's Sanctuary](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/allowak-yeti-egw.md) (see ""Allowak's Sanctuary Yeti Statistics"" later in this chapter). The yetis attempt to scare the characters away but do not wish to do harm. |
| 4 | The characters pass an Aeorian building that crashed nearby. The building contains `1d4 + 4` [wights](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/wight.md). |
| 5 | An [Aeorian absorber](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/aeorian-absorber-egw.md) (see "chapter 7") ambushes the characters. |
| 6 | The characters encounter a large herd of elk. If the characters scare the elk, `1d6` [elk](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/elk.md) attack while the rest of the herd flees. During the combat, a [remorhaz](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/remorhaz.md) bursts out of the snow and attacks indiscriminately. |
