# Angry Sorrowsworn
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 222, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 231*  

Relying on violence to sustain their existence, angry sorrowsworn—sometimes called the Angry—grow more powerful when their foes fight back. If a creature opts not to attack, though, this sorrowsworn becomes confused, and its attacks weaken. It also has two heads, which bicker with each other incessantly.

## Sorrowsworn

The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. Sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering inherent to the shadowy landscape and visit horror on those who stumble into their midst. Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress.
