**Thassa's Quests**

`dice: [](thassas-quests-mot.md#^thassas-quests)`

| dice: d6 | Adventure Goal |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Help a village of Thassa's faithful evacuate to the hills before Thassa sends a great wave to punish the village's willful coastal neighbors. |
| 2 | Phenax has learned the location of a sunken treasure in a flooded cave. Retrieve the treasure before his fortune-hunters can steal it from Thassa. |
| 3 | Smuggle a cargo of offerings for Thassa past harbor inspectors at Meletis, skirting new laws put into place at the behest of Heliod's priesthood that ban the import of items intended for sacrifice to other gods. |
| 4 | Find a magically stolen vessel sequestered high in the mountains and return it to the ocean. |
| 5 | Capture a great beast of the land and bring it to the shore as an offering for a kraken. |
| 6 | Humiliate a champion of another god (most likely Ephara, Karametra, Pharika, Iroas, or Mogis). |
