# Willowshade Oil
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 30 gp

A dark blue oil can be extracted from the rare fruit of the willowshade plant. A creature can use its action to apply the oil to another creature that has been [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) for less than 1 minute, causing the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition on that creature to end at the start of what would be that creature's next turn.
