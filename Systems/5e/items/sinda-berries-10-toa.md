# Sinda berries (10)
*Adventuring Gear, unknown*  

- **Cost**: 5 gp

These berries are dark brown and bitter. A full-grown sinda berry bush has `4d6` berries growing on it. A bush plucked of all its berries grows new berries in `1d4` months. Picked berries lose their freshness and efficacy after 24 hours.

Fresh sinda berries can be eaten raw or crushed and added to a drink to dull the bitterness. A creature that consumes at least ten fresh sinda berries gains advantage on saving throws against disease and poison for the next 24 hours.
