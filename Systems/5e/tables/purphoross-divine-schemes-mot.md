| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Enraged at Heliod's latest insult, Purphoros causes Mount Velus to erupt. The volcano's rage doesn't cease, though, threatening the region. |
| 2 | Insulted that the other gods don't appreciate his creations, Purphoros breaks the Nyx-infused chains that bind the ancient red dragon Thraxes, allowing it to go on a far-ranging rampage. |
| 3 | Gripped by sudden inspiration, Purphoros begins building a massive Nyx-bronze bridge that will link Mount Velus in the mortal world with Nyx itself. Every god opposes him in this effort. Can the construction effort be sabotaged without bringing the bridge tumbling down on the mortal world? |
| 4 | Purphoros's double, Petros, reveals an army of metal Nyxborn creatures and unleashes them against temples and settlements dedicated to other gods. The gods blame Purphoros for the attack, but he is too proud, and too fond of Petros, to stop the attacks. |
