# Wraps of Dyamak (Exalted)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a monk)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

Created and wielded by the ancient warrior-monk Dyamak, these thick strips of enchanted cloth are stained to appear dark crimson with blood of unknown origin. The current resting place of the wraps is unknown.

## Dormant

When the Wraps of Dyamak are in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your unarmed strike while wearing them.

In addition, when you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your total number of ki points.

## Awakened

When the Wraps of Dyamak reach an awakened state, they gain the following properties:

- The bonus to attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strike increases to +2.  
- You can cast the [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md) spell from the wraps as a bonus action, vanishing in a cloud of crimson mist. This property of the wraps can't be used again until you finish a short or long rest, or until you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike against a hostile creature.  

## Exalted

When the Wraps of Dyamak reach an exalted state, they gain the following properties:

- The bonus to attack and damage rolls with your unarmed strike increases to +3.  
- When you hit with an unarmed strike, you can choose to make the attack a ravenous strike. The target takes an extra `6d6` necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to the amount of necrotic damage dealt. This property of the wraps can't be used again until you finish a long rest, or until you score a critical hit with an unarmed strike against a hostile creature.
