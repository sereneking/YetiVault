# Oozing Vulture

## Salvage

An oozing vulture's feathers are prized by tailors and arcanists alike. A character can collect `2d10` feathers with a successful DC 10 Dexterity ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check. Each feather is worth 3 gp.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Oozing vultures have a vicious bite that can knock their victims prone.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Oozing vultures can track the smell of blood over great distances.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** An oozing vulture is enraged by the smell of blood and gains advantage on attacks against wounded prey.
