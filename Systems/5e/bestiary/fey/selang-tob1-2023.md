# Selang
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 321*  

*This grinning humanoid looks like a handsome man, if not for his glowing red eyes, insectoid legs, and antennae.*

## Dark Satyrs

The selang or dark satyrs are twisted and vicious fauns who have abandoned nature worship and instead venerate ancient gods of deep and malign intelligence. Selangs seek to help those evil gods enter the mortal world by opening dark portals and bridging a path to realms beyond mortal understanding.

## Battle Song and Laughter

Selangs relish battle, pain, and torture. They find violence thrilling and bloodshed exciting, and they often laugh, sing, and boast shamelessly during combat. Although they are the diplomats and spokesmen of the old gods, their manic speech and alien logic can sometimes be hard to follow. They are most comfortable with the slithering tones of Void Speech.

## Blasphemous Music

Selang cults and settlements are often found at the sites sacred to the dark gods, making hypnotic and alien harmonies with swarms of dorreqi. They are rarely the strongest soldiers, instead encouraging evil humanoids or other creatures of martial mien to fill the ranks, while the dark satyrs use their magic and poison against their foes.

## Traits

***Poisoned Weapons.*** The selang's weapons are coated with a magical poison. When the selang hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `3d6` poison damage (included in the attack).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The selang can use its Alien Piping. It then makes two Dagger or Poison Bolt attacks.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Poison Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`3d6 + 4`) poison damage.

***Alien Piping.*** The selang plays one of the following ear-bending melodies on alien pipes. One creature the selang can see within 60 feet of it is the only creature that can hear the melody. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the chosen melody.

- **Capering.** On the target's next turn, it must use all of its movement dancing without leaving its space, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws.  
- **Captivating.** The target is [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) until the end of its next turn, humming along to the selang's pleasant melody.  
- **Disorienting.** The target is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until the end of its next turn, and when it moves, it moves in a random direction.  
- **Drowsy.** The target falls [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) and dreams of evil entities and sinister portals for 10 minutes. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.  
- **Haunting.** The target is [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of its next turn, and it must take the Dash action and move away from the selang by the safest available route, unless there is nowhere to move.
