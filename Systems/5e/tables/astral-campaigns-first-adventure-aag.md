**First Adventure**

`dice: [](astral-campaigns-first-adventure-aag.md#^first-adventure)`

| dice: d10 | Adventure Seed |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | The adventure begins on the Rock of Bral, where an [autognome](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/autognome-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie") needs the characters' help to find its creator, who has gone missing on the Rock. |
| 2 | One of the characters inherits a ship equipped with a [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) and an old captain's log that hints at places to explore, treasure to find, and perils to avoid. |
| 3 | In the wilderness on their home world, the characters find a [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) in the wreckage of a crashed [scorpion ship](/Systems/5e/vehicles/scorpion-ship-aag.md) (see "chapter 2") and run afoul of goblins who want to plunder the wreck. |
| 4 | A wealthy patron gives the characters a ship and a [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) to call their own and expects them to accomplish a dangerous task in return. |
| 5 | A spelljamming ship lands on the outskirts of a village where the characters are staying. The ship's captain is looking for raw recruits to join a war in Wildspace. |
| 6 | Villagers ask the characters to investigate a strange object in the hills, which turns out to be a crashed [nightspider](/Systems/5e/vehicles/nightspider-aag.md) (see "chapter 2") with survivors: a [neogi pirate](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/neogi-pirate-bam.md) and a [neogi hatchling swarm](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/neogi-hatchling-swarm-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie" for both). |
| 7 | A [hadozee explorer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/hadozee-explorer-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie") needs the characters' help to slay a white [kindori](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/kindori-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie") that keeps attacking her [flying fish ship](/Systems/5e/vehicles/flying-fish-ship-aag.md) (see "chapter 2"). The hadozee can't tell whether the kindori is mean-spirited or amorous. Perhaps it has mistaken the ship for a rivalâ€”or a mate! |
| 8 | The characters were passengers aboard a spelljamming ship that crash-landed on a strange world after the [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) malfunctioned. The characters must fend off alien monsters until they are rescued. |
| 9 | The characters are hired by a trading company to protect a valuable cargo that's being delivered to a distant world. The characters become crew members aboard the [squid ship](/Systems/5e/vehicles/squid-ship-aag.md) (see "chapter 2") that is transporting the precious cargo. |
| 10 | The adventure begins on the Rock of Bral, where one or more characters have earned the enmity of a [plasmoid boss](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/plasmoid-boss-bam.md) (see "Boo's Astral Menagerie"). The heroes must either flee Bral to save themselves or contend with the boss's underlings. |
