| dice: d12 | Object |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | A war horn carved to resemble a dragon's head with a wide-open maw, which the dragon calls "Little Toot" |
| 2 | A statue depicting an elf paladin with the face turned upward; the body has been defaced by the dragon's claws |
| 3 | A mammoth tusk engraved with images depicting the history of a nomadic tribe; the dragon uses the tusk to mark the spot where it has buried its pile of gold |
| 4 | A giant-sized cloak decorated with silver braiding that the dragon uses as a nest lining for its egg |
| 5 | A wooden throne heaped with furs; any visitors must sit on the throne while the dragon recounts the grisly death of the seat's previous owner |
| 6 | A huge wooden door carved and painted to depict a monarch enthroned with sword and scepter; the dragon occasionally raps the door with its knuckles, pauses, and then chortles, "Nobody home" |
| 7 | A frost giant jarl's crown with broken horns; the dragon enjoys perching the crown on an icy stalagmite and then knocking it off with its tail |
| 8 | The prow of a ship carved to look like a pouncing lion; the dragon occasionally roars at the lion |
| 9 | A gilded shield emblazoned with the holy symbol of a forgotten god; the dragon enjoys flicking the shield with a claw to hear the sound it makes |
| 10 | A ceremonial anvil of dwarven make; gazing at the anvil, the dragon fondly recounts, "Seven at one blow!" |
| 11 | A long, embroidered linen tapestry showing the history of an ancient realm's civil war; the dragon "reads" the tapestry when it has trouble sleeping. |
| 12 | A bell engraved with images of an angelic host, still attached to its splintered belfry; the dragon tolls the bell with its tail, growling the name of one of its defeated foes with each ring |
