# Baphomet

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baphomet can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Illusory Room.** Baphomet casts mirage arcane, affecting a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. The effect ends on the next initiative count 20. Charisma is Baphomet's spellcasting ability for this spell.  
- **Reverse Gravity.** Baphomet chooses a room within the lair that is no larger in any dimension than 100 feet. Until the next initiative count 20, gravity is reversed within that room. Any creatures or objects in the room when this happens fall in the direction of the new pull of gravity, unless they have some means of remaining aloft. Baphomet can ignore the gravity reversal if he's in the room, although he likes to use this action to land on a ceiling to attack targets flying near it.  
- **Seal the Way.** Baphomet seals one doorway or other entryway within the lair. The opening must be unoccupied. It is filled with solid stone for 1 minute or until Baphomet takes this lair action again.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Baphomet's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Beguiling Realm.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) and Charisma ([Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance)) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks have advantage.  
- **Hedge Mazes.** Plant life within 1 mile of the lair grows thick and forms walls of trees, hedges, and other flora in the form of small mazes.  
- **Panicked Beasts.** Beasts within 1 mile of the lair become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) and disoriented, as though constantly under threat of being hunted, and might lash out or panic even when no visible threat is nearby.  

If Baphomet dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
