# Sage's Mirror
*Wondrous Item, rare*  


This item has 3 charges and regains all charges at dusk. You can use an action and expend 1 of the mirror's charges to cast one of the following spells:

- [Find the Path](/Systems/5e/spells/find-the-path.md)  
- [Legend Lore](/Systems/5e/spells/legend-lore.md)  

With each use, it is apparent that the information gleaned from the mirror comes from a chamber in the Nine Hells where sages and scholars are tortured for the answers to each question.
