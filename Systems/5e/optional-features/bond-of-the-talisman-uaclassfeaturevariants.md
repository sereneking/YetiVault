*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 11*  

**Prerequisite**: 12th-level, Pact of the Talisman

While someone else is wearing your talisman, you can use your action to teleport to the unoccupied space closest to them, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence. The wearer of your talisman can do the same thing, using their action to teleport to you.
