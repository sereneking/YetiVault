*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 162* 

| District | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Den'iyas | Founded by gnome immigrants from Zilargo, Den'iyas is a haven for those interested in Zil culture. It's home to many sages and artisans, and a hotbed of schemes and intrigue. | Upper Menthis |
| Ivy Towers | This residential district includes comfortable homes and modest apartments. Many of the students and faculty of Morgrave University live in Ivy Towers. | Upper Menthis |
| Seventh Tower | A shopping district, with restaurants and goods of comfortable to wealthy quality. Seventh Tower is especially noteworthy for Little Xen'drik, a collection of galleries whose owners buy and sell goods from Xen'drik. | Upper Menthis |
| University | This district is dominated by Morgrave University. It's also a nexus for sophisticated entertainment, including the Art Temple, the Grand Stage, and the Great Hall of Aureon. | Upper Menthis |
| Cassan Bridge | A mercantile district with goods of modest to comfortable quality. Home to a significant number of immigrants from the Shadow Marches, Cassan Bridge is the place to visit for exotic Marcher herbs and cuisine. | Middle Menthis |
| Everbright | This district is a source of magical goods and services. Exotic components, magewrights for hire, common or uncommon magic itemsâ€”all of these and more can be found here. | Middle Menthis |
| Little Plains | Founded by Talenta halflings, this district includes a central campground for visiting halfling nomads. The permanent residents are mostly halflings as well. Talentan foods and crafts can be found here, along with displays of traditional skills and pastimes. | Middle Menthis |
| Smoky Towers | Safer than the lower wards and less expensive than Upper Menthis, Smoky Towers has plenty of entertainment options. The Classic Theater is its most popular venue, but Smoky Towers offers a wide variety of more exotic fare. Dinner theater, changeling burlesque, and other diversions can be found in Smoky Towers. Thovanic Hall has begun performing works from Darguun and Droaam featuring monstrous performers. Smoky Towers has also become a haven for Cyran refugees wealthy enough to avoid High Walls. | Middle Menthis |
| Warden Towers | This district is the primary garrison of the Sharn Watch in Menthis. It's home to a community of Lhazaar immigrants, and the Broken Anchor is a tavern catering to Lhazaar travelers. | Middle Menthis |
| Downstairs | The Downstairs district is primarily known for food and drink. Though most of its taverns and inns are only modest in quality, the Four Sails serves some of the finest seafood in Sharn. The recent success of the Diamond Theater has also drawn travelers to the district. | Lower Menthis |
| Firelight | This district is a destination for those who seek illicit forms of entertainment. Many forms of illegal gambling and paid companionship can be found in Firelight. It's also the most common location of the Burning Ring. | Lower Menthis |
| Torchfire | A district with a notorious reputation, celebrated for cheap entertainment and infamous for its dangerous alleys. Its theaters specialize in musical comedy and lowbrow entertainment, and there are lots of opportunities for hopeful amateurs to get on a stage in Torchfire. | Lower Menthis |
