# Clothing, cold weather
*Adventuring Gear*  

- **Cost**: 10 gp
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

This outfit consists of a heavy fur coat or cloak over layers of wool clothing, as well as a fur-lined hat or hood, goggles, and fur-lined leather boots and gloves.

As long as cold weather clothing remains dry, its wearer automatically succeeds on saving throws against the effects of [extreme cold](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/extreme-cold.md).
