# Bullywug Croaker
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 232*  

Some bullywugs are born with the ability to weave magic into their songs. These rare specimens are raised in protected enclaves where they are taught to use their magic to both heal and harm. As demonstrated in Danger at Dunwater, they are among the most pompous of bullywugs.
