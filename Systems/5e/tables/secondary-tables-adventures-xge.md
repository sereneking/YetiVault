**Adventures**

`dice: [](secondary-tables-adventures-xge.md#^adventures)`

| dice: d100 | Outcome |
|------------|---------|
| 1-10 | You nearly died. You have nasty scars on your body, and you are missing an ear, `1d3` fingers, or `1d4` toes. |
| 11-20 | You suffered a grievous injury. Although the wound healed, it still pains you from time to time. |
| 21-30 | You were wounded, but in time you fully recovered. |
| 31-40 | You contracted a disease while exploring a filthy warren. You recovered from the disease, but you have a persistent cough, pockmarks on your skin, or prematurely gray hair. |
| 41-50 | You were poisoned by a trap or a monster. You recovered, but the next time you must make a saving throw against poison, you make the saving throw with disadvantage. |
| 51-60 | You lost something of sentimental value to you during your adventure. Remove one trinket from your possessions. |
| 61-70 | You were terribly frightened by something you encountered and ran away, abandoning your companions to their fate. |
| 71-80 | You learned a great deal during your adventure. The next time you make an ability check or a saving throw, you have advantage on the roll. |
| 81-90 | You found some treasure on your adventure. You have `2d6` gp left from your share of it. |
| 91-99 | You found a considerable amount of treasure on your adventure. You have `1d20+50` gp left from your share of it. |
| 100 | You came across a common magic item (of the DM's choice). |
