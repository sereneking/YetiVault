# Alyxian the Dispossessed

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Alyxian can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Avandra's Grasp.** Alyxian uses the power of Avandra's ruined temple (area H2) to create a watery tendril that rises out of the lake. One creature Alyxian can see that's not submerged in the lake must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the tendril. The tendril is a Large object that has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The tendril disappears when it is reduced to 0 hit points or the next time Alyxian takes a lair action.  
- **Corellon's Charm.** Alyxian causes a magical wisp of light to emerge from Corellon's ruined temple (area H3). The wisp enters the body of one creature Alyxian can see that isn't inside Corellon's ruined temple or atop the rocky island that supports it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Alyxian until initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Sehanine's Torment.** Alyxian uses the power of Sehanine's ruined temple (area H4) to create a watery form in the space of one creature that is either standing on the lake or submerged in it. The watery form assumes the vague likeness of the creature whose space it occupies and makes one melee weapon attack (+7 to hit) against it. On a hit, the attack deals 8 (`1d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. Whether it hits or misses, the watery form disappears after making its attack.  

### Prayers to the Gods

A character can use an action to pray to Avandra, Corellon, or Sehanine in the deity's prayer site. The character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check, and the check has advantage if the character is a worshiper of that god. On a successful check, the profane ruins atop the island melt away, and Alyxian can no longer use the lair action associated with that prayer site. In addition, Alyxian takes 14 (`4d6`) psychic damage, regardless of his current form.
