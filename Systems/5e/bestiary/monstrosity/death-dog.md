# Death Dog
*Source: Monster Manual p. 321, Storm King's Thunder, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, Light of Xaryxis, Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A death dog is an ugly two-headed hound that roams plains, deserts, and the Underdark. Hate burns in a death dog's heart, and a taste for humanoid flesh drives it to attack travelers and explorers. Death dog saliva carries a foul disease that causes a victim's flesh to slowly rot off the bone.

## Traits

***Two-Headed.*** The dog has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on saving throws against being [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned), or knocked [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dog makes two bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
