## Variant: Grey Hunter

As elite as they are, the members of the "Whitestone Rifle Corps" do not represent the apex of firearms skill in "Whitestone". A clandestine group of elite soldiers and survivalists is drawn secretly from the Rifle Corps ranks. Called the "Grey Hunters", these soldiers are special operatives of the de Rolo family, and loyally serve as spies, bodyguards, and even assassins when the job requires it. Though few officially know of them, rumors of the "Grey Hunters'" existence swirl constantly throughout the city-state, often in response to their activities after having been loaned out to protect "Whitestone's" allies.

You are one of these "Grey Hunters", even if just a trainee (if you're starting your campaign at low levels). You have the ear of the lord and lady of "Whitestone", though you must exercise this privilege graciously lest you lose it.

## Feature: Legacy of Secrecy

You have been entrusted with the use and care of a weapon both powerful and terrifying. The rifle you wield might transform the face of warfare and life in Tal'Dorei. It is a weapon that haunts the mind of its creator, [Percival de Rolo](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/percival-de-rolo-tdcsr.md), manifesting as a pain that lives always behind his kind eyes.

You were granted a [musket](/Systems/5e/items/musket.md) or a [pistol](/Systems/5e/items/pistol.md) by your commander in the "Whitestone Rifle Corps". This weapon is a symbol of your status, and when you display it, other folk around you—particularly adventurers, mercenaries, guards, engineers, and weapons enthusiasts—treat you differently. You might be seen as a noble defender of the people, a selfish hoarder of power, or anything in between, at the GM's discretion.

## Feature: Rifle Corps Relationship

You are—or were—a member of an elite and trusted band of "Whitestone's" staunchest defenders. Work with your GM to determine your current relationship with the Rifle Corps. If your campaign starts in "Whitestone", you might be an active member of that unit. Otherwise, you can use the Rifle Corps Relationships table for suggestions.

**Rifle Corps Relationships**

`dice: [](whitestone-rifle-corps-grey-hunter-variant-tdcsr.md#^rifle-corps-relationships)`

| dice: d6 | Current Relationship |
|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | I retired honorably from the Rifle Corps—and now it's time for me to pursue my own adventures. |
| 2 | I'm on an important mission to protect "Whitestone" or guard one of our allies. |
| 3 | "Whitestone" is in trouble, and I was sent away to seek help. |
| 4 | I don't think firearms technology should be kept secret, so I escaped from the Rifle Corps with my weapon and am on the run. |
| 5 | I was on a mission with my company when I got separated from them. Now I need to find my way back home. |
| 6 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original. ("Whitestone Hunter" variant only) |

## Suggested Characteristics

Those who join the "Whitestone Rifle Corps" become members of an elite and trusted band known as the city-state's staunchest defenders. But this means working with your GM to determine why you're not at home protecting "Whitestone". Perhaps you took on a mission to guard someone on behalf of the de Rolo family, or you might have been separated from your company while on an assignment. Either way, you find yourself embroiled now in a series of new adventures as you try to make your way back home.

Your bond is likely associated with your comrades-in-arms or with "Whitestone" itself. Your ideal could be tied to justice or protection, but could also be a secretive, selfish perversion of those virtues.

| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I want to make a good impression at all times. That means keeping my clothes and gear clean and in top condition. |
| 2 | I don't like being the center of attention. I'd rather let someone else do the talking while I watch their back. |
| 3 | I feel safe only if I'm carrying my trusty rifle. And my dagger. And my concealed pistol. Oh, and of course my.... |
| 4 | I don't trust people with my secrets easily, so it feels like a big deal when someone else shares a secret with me. |
| 5 | I like coming up with solutions to problems using my esoteric knowledge of natural philosophy. |
| 6 | Everyone around me takes things so seriously. Sometimes I just want to let loose and have fun! |
| 7 | Knowing things that other people don't know makes me feel special and important. |
| 8 | I'm most at home in woods and mountains, where everything feels at once familiar, always growing and changing. |

**Rifle Corps Ideals**

`dice: [](whitestone-rifle-corps-grey-hunter-variant-tdcsr.md#^rifle-corps-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Responsibility**. I have a duty to protect the people of "Whitestone" and to uphold the trust placed in me by the de Rolos. (Lawful) |
| 2 | **Militarization**. Everyone should have access to the most powerful weapons available, so they can defend themselves effectively. (Evil) |
| 3 | **Cooperation**. Any problem can be solved as long as people are willing to work together. (Good) |
| 4 | **Camaraderie**. It's important to have people you can trust to help out in a fight—and to uncork a bottle together afterward. (Any) |
| 5 | **Context**. There are no universal rights or wrongs. Every choice depends on the details of the situation. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | **Secrecy**. Information is valuable, but it can also be dangerous. I'll keep my mouth shut and gather as much intel as I can. (Neutral) |

| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I never knew what to do with myself until I joined the Rifle Corps. Now I have a purpose and comrades to give me direction. |
| 2 | One of my fellow Rifle Corps soldiers saved my life—and then I saved theirs. That kind of bond lasts forever. |
| 3 | "Whitestone" is the best city in all of Tal'Dorei. Nowhere else has been blessed by the Dawnfather and has a clock that tracks the movement of the stars! |
| 4 | My quick thinking saved a noble from assassination, and she showed me great kindness in return. I daren't say it, but I'm more loyal to her than I am to the de Rolos. |
| 5 | My weapon is my life. I clean it, repair it, and care for it—and it serves me loyally in return. |
| 6 | The people of "Whitestone" cared for my family when we had nothing. I promise to repay their compassion with my service. |

| 2 | I think being part of the Rifle Corps is so cool. I love telling people about my position so I can impress them. |
| 3 | My weapon was stolen. I built a new one, but I can't return home until I've tracked down the thief and recovered the original. |
| 4 | I'm tired of protecting spoiled people who don't know how to protect themselves. |
| 5 | I shoot first and ask questions later. |
