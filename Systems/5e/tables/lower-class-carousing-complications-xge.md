| 1 | A pickpocket lifts `1d10 Ã— 5` gp from you.* |
| 2 | A bar brawl leaves you with a scar.* |
| 3 | You have fuzzy memories of doing something very, very illegal, but can't remember exactly what. |
| 4 | You are banned from a tavern after some obnoxious behavior.* |
| 5 | After a few drinks, you swore in the town square to pursue a dangerous quest. |
| 6 | Surprise! You're married. |
| 7 | Streaking naked through the streets seemed like a great idea at the time. |
| 8 | Everyone is calling you by some weird, embarrassing nickname, like Puddle Drinker or Bench Slayer, and no one will say why.* |
