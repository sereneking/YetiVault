# Treefolk
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

The wise and ancient treefolk thrive in the depths of Eldraine's forested wilds. Though many treefolk rival members of the high fae in age, they rarely interfere with the goings-on of the faerie court. Instead, treefolk serve as guardians and shepherds of their wild groves, dispensing wisdom and blessings to travelers who wander under their branches.

## Traits

***Plant Camouflage.*** The treefolk has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks it makes in forest terrain.

***Tree Stride.*** Once on each of its turns, the treefolk can use 10 feet of its movement to step magically into one living tree within 5 feet of itself and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of itself that it can see, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree. Both trees must be at least as large as the treefolk.

***Spellcasting.*** The treefolk casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect poison and disease](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md), [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md)

**1/day**: [commune with nature](/Systems/5e/spells/commune-with-nature.md) (as an action)

**2/day each**: [enlarge/reduce](/Systems/5e/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), [speak with plants](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-plants.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The treefolk makes two Crushing Vine attacks, two Nightshade Bolt attacks, or one of each.

***Crushing Vine.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (`3d12 + 6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 18). While [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled), the creature also has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition. The treefolk can grapple up to six creatures this way.

***Nightshade Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (`6d10`) poison damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Oaken Boon.*** The treefolk blesses one creature other than itself that it can see within 60 feet of itself with the might and wisdom of the forest. While blessed in this way, a creature can use the treefolk's Tree Stride trait and gains 5 (`2d4`) temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns. This blessing lasts for 1 minute, until the treefolk has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition, or until the treefolk uses this bonus action again.
