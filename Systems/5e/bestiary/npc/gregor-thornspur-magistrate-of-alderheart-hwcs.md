# Gregor Thornspur, Magistrate of Alderheart
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Gregor is a dull-looking sable luma with a single errant feather that sticks out oddly from his brow. Gregor is the Magistrate of Alderheart, and though he appears to be a tired bureaucrat, his demeanour hides a shrewd businessman eager to turn any situation to his advantage. He is not above taking bribes in exchange for expediting requests to see the Birdfolk Council. Gregor uses the [noble](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of sable luma. He is chaotic neutral.

## Traits

***Glide.*** When falling at least 10 feet, Gregor can spend a reaction to fly up to his speed in one direction as he descends. He lands in an unoccupied space at the end of his movement, and takes no falling damage. He cannot glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though he can drop any held items as part of his reaction).

***Wing Flap.*** As a bonus action, Gregor can use his powerful feathered arms to propel himself upward a distance equal to half his movement speed. He can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding. 

***Fated (Recharges after a Long Rest).*** Gregor can choose to reroll any attack roll, skill check, or saving throw.

***Damage Resistance.*** Gregor is resistant to poison damage.

***Resilience.*** Gregor has advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).

## Actions

***Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d8 + 1`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Gregor adds 2 to his AC against one melee attack that would hit him. To do so, Gregor must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
