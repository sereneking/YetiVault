| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An [ancient blue dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md) is worried that no members of the younger generation are strong enough to inherit the ancient dragon's territory, and this elder is trying to start a war to test the younger dragons and determine which, if any, might be a worthy heir. |
| 2 | An [ancient blue dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md) without offspring has adopted wyrmlings of various colorsâ€”including a number stolen from the wyrmlings' parents. |
| 3 | An [ancient blue dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md) is training an [androsphinx](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md) as heir to the region the dragon rules and searching for magic items that will allow the sphinx to control the weather as the dragon does. |
| 4 | Under the pretense of helping an [ancient blue dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-blue-dragon.md) become a dracolich, an [archmage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) is actually hoping to claim the dragon's vast hoard. |
