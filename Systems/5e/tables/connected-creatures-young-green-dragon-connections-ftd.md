| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [young green dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) and a [treant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/treant.md) vie for influence over a woodland region. |
| 2 | A [young green dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) forces a group of [dryads](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) to collect treasures for the dragon's hoard, threatening to destroy their trees if they refuse. |
| 3 | An infestation of [twig blights](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/twig-blight.md) has taken over the lair of a [young green dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md), and the dragon will do anything to reclaim it. |
| 4 | [Green hags](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) compete to gain an alliance with a [young green dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md), turning a village into a staging ground for their games of deceit. |

| 6 | An [oni](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/oni.md) and a [young green dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-green-dragon.md) work together to terrorize a village, taking a victim every night and leaving the rest too frightened to flee. |
