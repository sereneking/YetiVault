# Topi
*Source: The Tortle Package p. 22*  

Topis are similar to zombies. Before a topi is animated, its corpse is shrunk until it stands only 2 feet tall, and its heart is cut out and replaced with a leather bag that contains a live poisonous snake. The snake requires neither air nor sustenance, and it magically renders the topi's claws venomous. When a topi dies, the snake inside it dies too. The process of creating a topi is known only to a handful of evil priests and necromancers.

Topis are more difficult to turn than ordinary zombies, and their spongy bodies make them resistant to bludgeoning.

## Undead Traits

A topi doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Turn Resistance.*** The topi has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the topi to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the topi drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions

***Venomous Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) slashing damage plus 2 (`1d4`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of the target's next turn.
