# Cloud Giant of Evil Air
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 125*  

Given their inherent link to elemental air, cloud giants who turn from the gods of the Ordning often gravitate to the service of Yan-C-Bin, Prince of Evil Air. These giants' cunning, charisma, and sheer physical and magical might make them well suited to leadership positions in the cults of Elemental Evil. A cult with a cloud giant at its head can be a formidable force of corruption and destruction in the world. As if that weren't enough, cloud giants often bring tremendous wealth with them, swelling the cult's coffers to finance more far-reaching operations.

A cloud giant dedicated to Evil Air wears a magic vest adorned with wings made from roc feathers and enchanted with elemental air, allowing the giant to fly. The vest functions only for the giant who wears it.
