**Above and Below Sharn: Noteworthy Locations**

| Location | Deascription | District |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| The Azure Gateway | This luxurious hotel and restaurant recently replaced an old Ghallanda inn. The menu is a "Galifar fusion," combining styles from across the Five Nations. | Skyway |
| The Celestial Vista | This legendary restaurant is owned by Skyway's city councilor, Lady Evix ir'Marasha. The floor is studded with crystal windows, allowing diners to look down into the city below. The food isn't incredible, but tourist crowds keep the Vista filled with customers. | Skyway |
| The Cloud Dragon | This restaurant serves traditional Brelish cuisine, and it does so exceptionally well. It's rarely as crowded as the other venues in Skyway, but locals know its value. | Skyway |
| The Dragon's Hoard | This resort, maintained by House Ghallanda, offers every luxury for those who can afford its high prices. | Skyway |
| Tain Manor | Sharn's social life revolves around the ir'Tain family. The monthly Tain Gala is the hottest ticket in town, and it's held at the family estate in Skyway. | Skyway |
| Mud Caves | This shantytown sits on the edge of Cliffside, where generations of destitute people have carved out homes in the cliff walls. It's a wretched existence, but most of the inhabitants have no other options. It also makes an excellent hiding place for fugitives. | Cliffside |
| Sharn's Welcome | Also known as the docks of Cliffside, this area is rough and dirty. Its taverns frequently host brawls, while the inns offer travelers a wide variety of ways to be cheated or robbed. | Cliffside |
| Ship's Towers | Drifting alongside the Cliffside docks is a collection of rafts, ships, and houseboats lashed together to form a floating community. | Cliffside |
| Keldoran Forge | Though most of the foundries in the Cogs are devoted to large-scale industry, the dwarf Antos Keldoran maintains a small forge and produces bespoke arms and armor. | Ashblack |
| The Pool of Onatar's Tears | A small temple in the Blackbones district holds a pool said to be blessed by the god Onatar. Smiths come from across Khorvaire to dip their tools in the pool. | Blackbones |
| The Red Hammer | The Red Hammer is Sharn's only inn maintained by and for warforged. It offers those who work in the Cogs opportunities to socialize, along with repair and cosmetic services. | Blackbones |
