`dice: [](rumorsprecinct-three-ggr.md#^rumorsprecinct-three)`

| dice: d6 | Rumor |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | "Something keeps spooking the pack animals. I wonder what it could be?" |
| 2 | "I hear there's an old granary in the rubblebelt that's filled with bandit plunder. Probably worth a peek!" |
| 3 | "The giant spiders above Velen's Rest have become aggressive as of late. I heard someone got poisoned by one yesterday." |
| 4 | "Can you believe they're going to close Vitu-Ghazi to visitors tomorrow? I wonder what's going on." |
| 5 | "Those rumblings that shook the ground last night were definitely wurms tunneling. I'm sure the Selesnya aren't pleased." |
| 6 | "We should go find that loxodon priest and see if she's still having visions. I'll bet we can get her to tell us our future!" |
