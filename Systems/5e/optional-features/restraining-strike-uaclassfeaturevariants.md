# Restraining Strike
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 5*  

Immediately after you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action to grapple the target (see chapter 9 in the Player's Handbook for rules on grappling). Add the superiority die to your Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. The target is also [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) while [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way.
