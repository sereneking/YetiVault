# Variant: Mixing Potions; Potion Miscibility
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 140* 

**Potion Miscibility**

`dice: [](variant-mixing-potions-potion-miscibility.md#^potion-miscibility)`

| dice: d100 | Result |
|------------|--------|
| 01 | The mixture creates a magical explosion, dealing `6d10` force damage to the mixer and `1d10` force damage to each creature within 5 feet of the mixer. |
| 02-08 | The mixture becomes an ingested poison of the DM's choice. |
| 09-15 | Both potions lose their effects. |
| 16-25 | One potion loses its effect. |
| 26-35 | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. A potion has no effect if it can't be halved in this way. |
| 36-90 | Both potions work normally. |
| 91-99 | The numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00 | Only one potion works, but its effect is permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent, or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a [potion of healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing.md) might increase the drinker's hit point maximum by 4, or [oil of etherealness](/Systems/5e/items/oil-of-etherealness.md) might permanently trap the user in the Ethereal Plane. At your discretion, an appropriate spell, such as [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md) or [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md), might end this lasting effect. |
