# Scribe's Pen
*Wondrous Item, common (requires attunement by a creature with the Mark of Scribing)*  


You can use this pen to write on any surface. You decide whether the writing is visible or [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible), but the writing is always visible to a person with the Mark of Scribing.

Any creature with the Mark of Scribing can use an action to touch the [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) writing, making it visible to all.

If you use the pen to write on a creature that isn't a construct, the writing fades after 7 days.
