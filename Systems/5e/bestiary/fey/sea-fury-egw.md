# Sea Fury
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 299*  

In times of great danger, sea hags form massive covens to channel powerful magic against outside threats. But when the threat is vanquished, these covens often destroy themselves from within. One sea hag grows more powerful than the others, killing its kin one by one and siphoning their magical power as it does so.

Driven to madness by the power it claims—and by the loneliness that is the cost of its killing spree—the hag becomes a sea fury, which hoards treasure, spreads rumors, and does everything within its power to lure sailors and explorers to its lair. By doing so, it hopes to break its loneliness for a time—and then to destroy its new playthings when they have outlived their usefulness.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the sea fury fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The sea fury has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The sea fury's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, `+8` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [witch bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/witch-bolt.md)

**1/day each**: [bestow curse](/Systems/5e/spells/bestow-curse.md), [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md), [thunderwave](/Systems/5e/spells/thunderwave.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sea fury makes two attacks with its claws.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Death Glare.*** The sea fury targets one [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.

## Legendary Actions

***As Water.*** The sea fury transforms into a wave of foaming seawater, along with whatever it is wearing or carrying, and moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. While in this form, it can't be [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) or [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). It reverts to its true form at the end of this movement.

***Fearsome Apparition (Costs 2 Actions).*** The sea fury conjures an apparition of one of its dead sisters, which appears in an unoccupied space the sea fury can see within 30 feet of it. Enemies of the sea fury that can see the apparition must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of it until it vanishes at the end of the sea fury's next turn.

***Conjure Snakes (Costs 3 Actions).*** The sea fury disgorges a [swarm of poisonous snakes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md), which occupies the same space as the sea fury, acts on its own initiative count, and attacks as directed by the sea fury. The sea fury can control up to three of these swarms at a time.
