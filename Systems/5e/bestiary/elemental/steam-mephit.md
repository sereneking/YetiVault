# Steam Mephit
*Source: Monster Manual p. 217, Princes of the Apocalypse, Storm King's Thunder, Tales from the Yawning Portal, Tomb of Annihilation, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, Turn of Fortune's Wheel, Dungeons of Drakkenheim. Available in the SRD.*  

## Mephits

Mephits are capricious, imp-like creatures native to the elemental planes. They come in six varieties, each one representing the mixture of two elements.

Ageless tricksters, mephits gather in large numbers on the Elemental Planes and in the Elemental Chaos. They also find their way to the Material Plane, where they prefer to dwell in places where their base elements are abundant. For example, a magma mephit is composed of earth and fire, and it favors volcanic lairs, while an ice mephit, which is composed of air and water, favors frigid locales.

### Elemental Nature

A mephit doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

## Steam Mephit

Composed of fire and water, steam mephits leave trails of hot water wherever they go, and they hiss with tendrils of steam. Bossy and hypersensitive, they are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits.
