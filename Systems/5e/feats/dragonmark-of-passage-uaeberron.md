**Prerequisite**: [Human](/Systems/5e/races/human.md)

You have the magical mark of Passage, the dragonmark of House Orien, and are a member of that house.

Once you cast a given spell this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it innately again. You must still expend any material components.
