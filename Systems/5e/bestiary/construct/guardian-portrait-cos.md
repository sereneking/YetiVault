# Guardian Portrait
*Source: Curse of Strahd p. 227*  

A guardian portrait looks like a finely rendered and beautifully framed work of art, usually depicting someone important in a realistic manner. The picture and its frame are bound with powerful magic and are inseparable.

## Living Image

The eyes of the figure depicted in the painting are imbued with [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision), and they appear to follow creatures that move in front of them.

## Innate Spells

When a guardian portrait attacks, the figure in the painting animates and moves as though alive (albeit in two dimensions). The guardian portrait has no effective melee attacks, but it has a repertoire of innate spells that it can cast. When it casts a spell, the figure painted on the canvas makes all the appropriate somatic gestures and verbal incantations for the spell.

## Traits

***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The portrait is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) while in the area of an [antimagic field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md). If targeted by [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), the portrait must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or become [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the figure in the portrait remains motionless, the portrait is indistinguishable from a normal painting.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The portrait's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 12). The portrait can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**3/day each**: [counterspell](/Systems/5e/spells/counterspell.md), [crown of madness](/Systems/5e/spells/crown-of-madness.md), [hypnotic pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md), [telekinesis](/Systems/5e/spells/telekinesis.md)
