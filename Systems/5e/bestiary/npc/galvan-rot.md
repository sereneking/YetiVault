## Traits

***5etools Note.*** While Galvan is not presented in an encounter in The Rise of Tiamat, the [dragonsoul](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/dragonsoul-rot.md) stat block has been provided here for ease of use, with optional alterations for the [Blue Dragon Mask](/Systems/5e/items/blue-dragon-mask-rotos.md).

***Special Equipment.*** Galvan has the [Blue Dragon Mask](/Systems/5e/items/blue-dragon-mask-rotos.md).

***Draconic Majesty.*** While wearing no armor and wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, Galvan adds his Charisma bonus to her AC (included).

***Lingering Shock.*** If Galvan deals lightning damage to a creature while wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, that creature can't take reactions until its next turn.

***Legendary Resistance (1/Day).*** If Galvan fails a saving throw while wearing the Blue Dragon Mask, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Dragon Fanatic.*** Galvan has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened). While Galvan can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, Galvan ignores the effects of being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if Galvan makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (`3d6`) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** Galvan can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** Galvan has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Galvan's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Galvan attacks twice with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) damage of the type to which Galvan has resistance.

***Orb of Dragon's Breath (3/Day).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (`6d8`) damage of the type to which Galvan has damage resistance.
