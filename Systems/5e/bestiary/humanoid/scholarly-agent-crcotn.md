# Scholarly Agent
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 206*  

Scholarly agents are low-ranking members of an academic organization. They know a few tricks to help them avoid danger, and they study magic that enables them to decipher secrets of the past and identify magical relics.

## Scholars of Allsight

The Allegiance of Allsight is a scholarly faction that operates primarily within the Marquesian metropolis of Ank'Harel. Though most members of the allegiance are academics unfamiliar with combat, the faction's field agents are skilled archaeologists who are also trained to contend with and overcome the threats that lurk in the depths of Exandria.
