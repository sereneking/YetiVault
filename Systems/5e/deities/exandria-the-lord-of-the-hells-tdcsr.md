- **Alternate Names**: The Lord of the Nine Hells, Asmodeus
- **Alignment**: Lawful Evil
- **Category**: Betrayer Gods
- **Domains**: Order, Trickery, War
- **Pantheon**: Exandria
- **Province**: God of devils and the Hells
- **Symbol**: A black crown with four red horns ascending from the top of it and two black and red horns curving out on the sides. Five black gems are embossed into the crown, with one lone black horn rising from the center.

The devil god of the Hells is the master of tyranny and domination, and was the first to instill his despotic will into celestials, creating the first devils. His words are honeyed and carefully crafted, soothing and corrupting the hearts of mortals and immortals alike. The Lord of the Hells rules his domain with an iron fist, and the punishments awaiting those that cross him are the stuff of nightmares. Evil entities pay him tribute right alongside his devils, and many warlocks are drawn to his power.

## Depiction

A twisted image of the celestial blood that once bore him, the Lord of the Hells is portrayed in many tomes and murals as a handsome humanoid with deep red skin and long black hair. Two curling horns rise from his crowned brow, and his lips bear an eternal, knowing grin.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Lord of the Hells' clerics are granted powers of Order, Trickery, or War.

## Enemies

The Lord of the Hells' enemies are numerous, even among the "Betrayer Gods", many of whom only follow him for fear of his immense power. His arch-nemesis is the Changebringer, whose mischief and cunning has vexed him throughout the eons. It was she who defeated him in the "Calamity" by tricking his fiendish armies into attacking one another.

The Devil Lord's greatest triumph during the "Calamity" was fooling and betraying the Everlight and slaughtering all her followers in one fell stroke—a move that today has united the followers of the Everlight and the Changebringer in a bond of unbreakable fellowship.

- Assert dominance and power over others. Show your strength of will in the image of your Lord.  
- Repay cruelty done unto you with further evil. If others show you kindness, exploit it.  
- As you ascend to power, do not pity or show mercy to those you climb over to get there. The weak do not warrant your compassion—compassion itself isa weakness.
