## Actions

***Gythka.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Chatkcha.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Chameleon Carapace.*** The thri-kreen changes the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks it makes to hide in those surroundings.

***Leap.*** The thri-kreen leaps up to 20 feet in any direction, provided its speed isn't 0.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The thri-kreen adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the thri-kreen must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
