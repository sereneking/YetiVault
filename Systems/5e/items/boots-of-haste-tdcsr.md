# Boots of Haste
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear these boots, you can click your heels together to cast the [haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) spell on yourself as a bonus action. You don't suffer from lethargy when the spell ends when cast using these boots. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until next dawn.
