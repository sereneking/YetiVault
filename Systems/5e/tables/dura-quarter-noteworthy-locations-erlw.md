**Dura Quarter: Noteworthy Locations**

| Location | Description | District |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| The Citadel of the Sun | A temple devoted to Dol Arrah, noteworthy for the three blessed griffons that reside there. | Hope's Peak, Upper Dura |
| The Clifftop Adventurer's Guild | An institution that provides adventurers with camaraderie and profitable work. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Drunken Dragon | A tavern frequented by members of the Clifftop Adventurer's Guild. The food is modest, but it has the widest selection of exotic alcohol in Sharn. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Esoteric Order of Aureon | The guildhall of one of Sharn's most prestigious arcane orders. A reliable source for arcane spellcasting services. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| The Gold & White | This tavern offers fare of comfortable quality at modest prices. It caters to members of the Sharn Watch and Brelish veterans, but others will receive a cold welcome. | Daggerwatch, Upper Dura |
| Moraggan's | A posh tavern specializing in strong Mror spirits. Food and drink are wealthy in quality and cost. | Highhold, Upper Dura |
| The Mystic Market | A collection of shops specializing in different categories of magic items. Most merchandise is common or uncommon, but rare items are occasionally available. | Clifftop, Upper Dura |
| Pegasus Spire | The seat of House Vadalis in Sharn is one of the few enclaves where pegasi are raised and trained. Native to Syrania, these celestial beasts can become stranded in Sharn; Vadalis heirs care for them and match them with virtuous companions. | Highwater, Upper Dura |
| Ghallanda Hall | This proud Ghallanda enclave continues to operate amid the fading squalor of Middle Dura, and has become a tourist attraction. It offers a range of services, with food and lodging of poor to comfortable quality. | Underlook, Middle Dura |
| The Hollow Tower | A vertically oriented arena used for aerial jousting and other unusual sporting events. | Hareth's Folly, Middle Dura |
| The King of Fire | A comfortable tavern and gambling hall, known as one of the safest places to bet on the Race of Eight Winds and the events at the Hollow Tower. | Hareth's Folly, Middle Dura |
| The Anvil | This fading Ghallanda inn struggles to maintain its poor to modest quality. It's known to be under the protection of the Boromar Clan, which makes it one of the safest establishments in Lower Dura. | Callestan, Lower Dura |
| The Broken Mirror | A curious tavern owned by a family of changelings, the Broken Mirror changes its appearance and theme every week. It's rumored to be connected to the Tyrants. | Callestan, Lower Dura |
| The Silvermist Theater | A remnant of Callestan's glory days, this place is a shadow of the grand establishment it once was. The current owners are known for staging bizarre events at the Silvermist. Since the Sharn Watch stays out of Callestan, anything can happen here. | Callestan, Lower Dura |
