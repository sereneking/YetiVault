# Kakkuu Spyder-Fiend
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 234*  

Resembling enormous spiders, kakkuus are the most numerous and least intelligent spyder-fiends. In large conflicts, they serve as foot soldiers, but they prefer to avoid more powerful Fiends, who boss them around. Left on their own, kakkuus lurk in ambush and use their webs to snare prey.

## Spyder-Fiends

Demonic beasts that combine the worst attributes of wolves and spiders, spyder-fiends scuttle about with bloated, spiderlike bodies and gnash with wolflike heads. Spyder-fiends are usually coated with gore, as brutal killing is their favorite pursuit. They spin durable webs and are ingenious in how they employ their webs against prey.

Spyder-fiends are organized into a hierarchy based on might and cunning, with higher-ranked spyder-fiends dominating lower ranks. Spyder-fiends of equivalent rank scheme against each other for advancement and eagerly turn against one another if treachery can improve their position.

Spyder-fiends loyally serve their general, Miska the Wolf-Spider. While they were rarely seen during Miska's imprisonment in Pandemonium, they have become increasingly active as Miska struggles to free himself in Pandesmos.
