**Favorite Trophies**

`dice: [](sign-of-success-favorite-trophies-ai.md#^favorite-trophies)`

| dice: d10 | Trophy |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | The handkerchief of a noble's paramour, with their initials sewn into it as well as the date and the place the gift was given. Perfect blackmail fodder. |
| 2 | A silver goblet from the kitchens of a castle in a wealthy land. It still smells of the wonderful burgundy that was in it when you stole it. |
| 3 | A gold-tipped fountain pen stolen from the breast pocket of a royal wizard. |
| 4 | A piece of intricately woven curtain you had to cut to escape a mayor's manor after stealing their valuables. |
| 5 | A gray cat with white feet, once the pet of a rich merchant's spoiled child. She almost blew your cover. Now she knows when to keep quiet, and she's great at catching mice. |
| 6 | A small statue of a ballerina, broken off from a marble fountain in a city from which you're now banned. |
| 7 | A serpentine lapel pin set with tiny diamonds, which you slipped off the chest of a noble whose fete you finessed your way into. |
| 8 | The solid-gold hammer holy symbol of that one rude blacksmith who refused to fix your sword. |
| 9 | A full potion bottle from the temple of Oghma, marked "Drink in case of emergency." So far, no one has dared you to drink it. |
| 10 | A cracked mirror from a mystic's tower, which sometimes shows you a glint of another realm in one of its shards. |
