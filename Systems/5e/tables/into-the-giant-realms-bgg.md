`dice: [](into-the-giant-realms-bgg.md#^into-the-giant-realms)`

| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A fissure opens during an earthquake, and ordinary means can't determine its depth. Adventurers are asked to explore it and determine the source of the light that is barely visible far below. |
| 2 | Characters find a coded journal in a dragon's treasure hoard, indicating a path to a hidden paradise. |
| 3 | Adventurers find a giant-sized ring inscribed with the sigil sequence for a teleportation circle. |
| 4 | An enormous stone archway is carved with symbols that, when touched in the correct sequence, activate a portal. |
| 5 | A strange map shows a road where no road exists. During solstices, the road appears and stretches in an impossible direction to a mysterious destination. |
| 6 | Characters acquire a broken piece of an artifact that magically guides them to the location of another piece, which is in a realm of giants. |
