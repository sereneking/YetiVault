**Risia Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](risia-the-plain-of-ice-risia-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^risia-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Spells that deal cold damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals cold damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 2 | Veins of cobalt-blue ice run through a glacier in the area. If extracted, this ice maintains its temperature and doesn't melt. An object carved from it can function as a spellcasting focus for spells dealing with water or ice. |
| 3 | Abominable yetis lair in a network of bitterly cold, frost-rimed caves in the mountains. |
| 4 | Any spell that deals fire damage deals just half the normal damage. |
