## Traits

Instead of choosing one of the game's races for your character at 1st level, you can use the following traits to represent your character's lineage, giving you full control over how your character's origin shaped them:

### Creature Type

You are a humanoid. You determine your appearance and whether you resemble any of your kin.

### Size

You are Small or Medium (your choice).

### Feat

You gain one feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Variable Trait

You gain one of the following options of your choice: (a) [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) with a range of 60 feet or (b) proficiency in one skill of your choice.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language that you and your DM agree is appropriate for your character.

Your race is considered to be a Custom Lineage for any game feature that requires a certain race, such as elf or dwarf.
