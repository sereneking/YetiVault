## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Karavarix fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Unusual Nature.*** Karavarix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Karavarix makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and Karavarix can't bite a different target.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft. one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d8 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Cataclysmic Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Karavarix exhales a wave of ghostly purple flames in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (`10d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature dies if the breath reduces it to 0 hit points. Additionally, any Medium or smaller Humanoid killed by the breath's damage, as well as every corpse of such a creature within the cone, becomes a zombie (see the Monster Manual) under Karavarix's control. The zombie acts on Karavarix's initiative but immediately after Karavarix's turn. Absent any other command, the zombie tries to kill any non-Undead creature it encounters.

## Legendary Actions

***Claw.*** Karavarix makes one Claw attack.

***Cataclysmic Rush (Costs 2 Actions).*** Karavarix moves up to half its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks, carrying with it any creatures it is grappling. During this move, if it enters the space of a Medium or smaller creature, that creature takes 4 (`1d8`) necrotic damage. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.
