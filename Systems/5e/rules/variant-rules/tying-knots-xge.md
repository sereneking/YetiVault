# Tying Knots
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* 

The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one. Here's an optional rule for determining the effectiveness of a knot.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence ([Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence ([Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check.

This rule intentionally links [Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule in the [Skills with Different Abilities](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/skills-with-different-abilities.md) section in chapter 7 of the player's handbook.
