# Familiars
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [crawling claw](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md), an [imp](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/imp.md), a [pseudodragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md), or a [quasit](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/quasit.md).
