## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** East Wind is armed with a longsword that is a [polymorph blade](/Systems/5e/items/polymorph-blade-llk.md).

***Unarmored Defense.*** While East Wind is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** East Wind makes three unarmed strikes or three dart attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, East Wind can choose one of the following additional effects:

- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (adept's choice).  
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of East Wind's next turn.  

***Dart.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Polymorph Blade.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage. If East Wind rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of a [polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/polymorph.md) spell.

## Reactions

***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, East Wind deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, East Wind catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and East Wind has a hand free.
