# Asteroid Spider
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 1: Spelljammer Creatures p. 3*  

An asteroid spider is a menace native to Wildspace and the Astral Sea. A full-grown specimen has a body 30 feet in diameter and legs that are at least 30 feet long. When it wraps its legs tightly around its body and closes its eyes, the asteroid spider resembles nothing so much as a giant, lifeless rock in space—hence its name.

An asteroid spider has its own gravity plane and air envelope, as well as multiple spinnerets with which it can create web strands. Its living brain functions like a *spelljamming helm*, allowing the spider to travel through Wildspace without a ship. It often haunts asteroid belts, lurking among normal asteroids until a spelljamming ship comes close enough to be detected. The spider then snares the ship before using web strands to catch crew members and reel them toward its snapping jaws.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the spider is motionless, has its eyes and mouth closed, and has its legs wrapped around its body at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the spider move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the spider is anything other than an asteroid.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the spider fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Unusual Nature.*** The spider doesn't require air.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spider makes two Web Strand attacks, uses Reel, and makes two Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`3d8 + 8`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) acid damage.

***Web Strand.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 18). The web strand can be attacked and destroyed (AC 12; 20 hit points; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage). The spider can grapple up to six creatures at a time using its web strands.

***Reel.*** The spider pulls each creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it up to 60 feet straight toward itself.

## Bonus Actions

***Snare Ship (1/Day).*** The spider weaves a magical web around a spelljamming ship it can see within 120 feet of itself. The web lasts for 1 minute and suppresses the magic of any spelljamming helm aboard the ship. Decks and other surfaces of the ship that aren't enclosed become difficult terrain until the effect ends. The web is impervious to damage but is destroyed by a successful casting of [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md) (DC 18).
