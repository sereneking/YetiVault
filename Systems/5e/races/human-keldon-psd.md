## Description

The people of Keld are human, but they are like no other humans anywhere. Nearly all adults stand over six feet tall, and heights above seven feet are not uncommon. They are massively muscled and have gray skin, ranging from an ashy gray-white to a deeper bluegray. The typical [Human (Keldon)](/Systems/5e/races/human-keldon-psd.md)'s hairline points sharply down in the middle of the forehead and at either temple, but recedes elsewhere—sometimes dramatically. [Keldons](/Systems/5e/races/human-keldon-psd.md) are remarkably resistant to the cold of their homeland, baring skin even in near-freezing temperatures without discomfort.

Keldons value self-reliance, strength, and courage above all else. Anything that is the product of their own labor is a fine thing. Anything else is treated with a healthy dose of skepticism. At best, they are a proud, pragmatic, passionate people, and their loyalty is fierce once earned. At worst, they can be reckless, hot-tempered, and violent—and no small number of Keldons still consider these qualities virtues rather than vices.

Because of their many exploits as both conquerors and mercenaries, Keldons appear in the legends and histories of other peoples across the world. Sometimes these tales are exaggerated—but many that sound exaggerated are not.
