# Ghelryn Foehammer
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 255*  

The blacksmith Ghelryn has a good heart, but he hates orcs and giants-hates them with a fiery passion. He considers it the solemn duty of all dwarves to cave in their skulls!

Ideal:"It is incumbent upon every dwarf to forge a legacy."

Bond:"I stand for Clan Foehammer and all dwarvenkind."

Flaw:"I never run from a fight, especially if it involves killing orcs or giants."
