## Traits

***Hold Breath.*** The two-headed crocodile can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

***Two Heads.*** The two-headed crocodile has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks and on saving throws against being [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned), and knocked [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious).

***Wakeful.*** When one of the crocodile's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The two-headed crocodile makes two attacks with its bite.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and that head of the crocodile can't bite another target.
