# Fzeg

## Salvage

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist's supplies can use 1 pint of blood from a fzeg and mix it with silver and other reagents worth 50 gp to create a [lycanthropy antidote](/Systems/5e/items/lycanthropy-antidote-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis). A slain fzeg has 10 (`1d4 + 2`) usable pints of blood. The blood of a fzeglaich can be used, but it takes five times as much blood and twice as long to brew. Creating the antidote takes 4 hours of work and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** A fzeg is a mix of werewolf and vampire but has fewer weaknesses. The creature is resistant to nonmagical attacks.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** With its bite, a fzeg can drain life force and curse a person with werewolf lycanthropy. Someone who dies from a fzeg's bite becomes a fzeglaich, a creature like the fzeg and loyal to it.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** A fzeg can transform into humanoid form. It's natural form, however, is that of a wolf-human hybrid. This vampiric monster isn't vulnerable to sunlight, but radiant damage prevents it from regenerating.  

> [!note] GM Advice
> 
> An ambitious DM could imagine a fzeg at the lead of a force including other werewolf-undead hybrids. Combined with a ghoul or ghast, the creature would paralyze, or combined with a wight, it would drain the life and lower the maximum hit points of a target. Similarly, other kinds of lycanthropes could become undead and wield hybrid powers.

## Traits

***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The fzeg has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing or smell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the fzeg fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Rampage.*** When the fzeg reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the fzeg can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

***Regeneration.*** The fzeg regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the fzeg takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the fzeg's next turn.

***Shapechanger.*** The fzeg can use its action to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid or back into its true form, that of a wolfhumanoid hybrid. It can transform its body parts as part of attacking with them and can choose whether the change remains after making the attack. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it's wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

***Spider Climb.*** The fzeg can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fzeg uses its howl, then attacks once with its bite and twice with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 17 (`5d6`) necrotic damage and is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. A humanoid slain after being bitten rises the following night as a fzeglaich under the fzeg's control.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Howl.*** Each creature of the fzeg's choice that is within 300 feet of the fzeg and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the fzeg's Howl for the next 24 hours or until it is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) by the fzeg.

***Night Children (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The fzeg magically calls eight wolves. These wolves arrive in 2 rounds, acting as allies of the fzeg and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts remain for 1 hour, until the fzeg dies, or until the fzeg dismisses them as a bonus action.

## Legendary Actions

***Move.*** The fzeg moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Claws.*** The fzeg attacks with its claws.

***Incite.*** The fzeg chooses one creature that is of a lower Challenge, has a bite attack, and is within 60 feet of the fzeg. Provided the target can see or hear the fzeg, that creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

***Bite (Costs 2 Actions).*** The fzeg attacks with its bite.
