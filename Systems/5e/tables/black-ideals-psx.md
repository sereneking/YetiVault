**Black Ideals**

`dice: [](black-ideals-psx.md#^black-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Power.** Power is the only way to guarantee your ability to control your lifeâ€”and thus your happiness. |
| 2 | **Self-Interest.** If I don't look out for myself, no one else is going to. |
| 3 | Strength. Helping the weak is merely delaying their inevitable failure. |
| 4 | **Freedom.** If I need something, I'm a fool if I let laws or morality stand in my way. |
| 5 | **Greed.** The clearest way to get ahead in this world is with money. |
| 6 | **Independence.** No one tells me what to do. |
