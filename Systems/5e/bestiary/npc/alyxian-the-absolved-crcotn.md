## Traits

***Divinely Blessed.*** Alyxian can't be [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) and can't be changed into another form against his will.

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** Alyxian casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting modifier (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [guidance](/Systems/5e/spells/guidance.md), [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [lesser restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Alyxian makes two Spear attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 9 (`2d8`) radiant damage.

***Force Wave (1/Day).*** Alyxian strikes the ground, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward. Each creature he chooses within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on himself must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 35 (`10d6`) force damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). A creature that succeeds on the saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** Alyxian adds 3 to his AC against one attack roll that would hit him. To do so, Alyxian must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Arch Heart's Strike.*** Alyxian makes one Spear attack, and all damage from this attack is radiant.

***Change Bringer's Dance.*** Alyxian moves up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Moon Weaver's Veil (Costs 2 Actions).*** Alyxian becomes [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the end of his next turn. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying becomes [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with him.
