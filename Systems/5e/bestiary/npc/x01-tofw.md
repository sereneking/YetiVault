## Traits

***Axiomatic Mind.*** X01 can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

***Combat Ready.*** X01 has advantage on initiative rolls.

***Disintegration.*** If X01 dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind anything it was carrying.

***Legendary Resistance (4/Day).*** If X01 fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** X01 casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [mending](/Systems/5e/spells/mending.md) (as an action)

**1/day each**: [plane shift](/Systems/5e/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only), [protection from evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** X01 makes one Pincer attack and two Tentacle attacks.

***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (`3d6`) force damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) piercing damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, X01 can't use this tentacle against other targets. X01 has six tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

## Reactions

X01 can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn.

***Counter Magic.*** X01 attempts to interrupt a creature it can see that is casting a spell. If the spell is 3rd level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 4th level or higher, X01 makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect.

***Lightning Rebuke.*** When a creature within 120 feet of X01 damages it, X01 magically retaliates with an arc of lightning. The creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
