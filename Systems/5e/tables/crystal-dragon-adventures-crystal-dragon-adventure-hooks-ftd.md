| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A towering palace of ice and quartz that was once the abode of an [ancient crystal dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) is found deserted, with no clue as to whether its master will return or whether some other creature has claimed it. |
| 2 | Prismatic shards rain from the sky in a beautiful but dangerous display. Rumors quickly spread that a crystal dragon is responsible. |
| 3 | A crystal dragon invites the greatest bards and philosophers to partake in "the Great Dialogue" in the dragon's mountaintop lair. But only the dragon knows that the Great Dialogue has no end, and no one can leave the lair once it has begun. |
| 4 | A crystal dragon intent on exploring a new world of the Material Plane has acquired a magic ship for the journey and now just needs a brave crew. |
| 5 | A crystal dragon who has guarded a mountain pass for decades unexpectedly retires to the Elemental Plane of Air. Monstrous forces immediately move into the areaâ€”and might take control of the pass unless the dragon can be convinced to return. |
| 6 | A royal heir goes missing while secretly visiting a crystal dragon. The heir's family, the heir's friends, and the dragon all want to find the heir, but no faction trusts the others. |
| 7 | A crystal dragon seeks bold adventurers to steal an egg from an [ancient white dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) who is infamous for abject cruelty and utter remorselessness. |
| 8 | A crystal dragon has ripped open holes to the Elemental Planes of Air and Water, creating flash glaciation that encroaches upon inhabited lands. |
