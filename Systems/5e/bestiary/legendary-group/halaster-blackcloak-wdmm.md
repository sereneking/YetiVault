# Halaster Blackcloak

## Lair actions
_Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Halaster takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Halaster targets a volume of unoccupied space or solid stone no larger than four 10-foot cubes within 30 feet of him, turning the open space to solid, worked stone or vice versa.  
- Halaster causes one door or archway within 30 feet of him to disappear and be replaced by a blank wall, or he restores a door or an archway previously removed in this way.  
- Halaster deactivates or reactivates one of Undermountain's magic gates. The gate must be within 120 feet of him.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage_

When Halaster is in Undermountain, the following effects can occur in any location within the dungeon or in any extraplanar extension of the dungeon:

- A magical scrying sensor appears, taking the form of a ghostly, 1-foot-diameter humanoid eye surrounded by motes of light. The sensor is stationary, though Halaster can reorient the eye to face in any direction. Halaster can see through the eye as though he was in its space. The eye can't be harmed or dispelled, but it winks out within an [antimagic field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md). A scrying eye lasts until Halaster ends the effect (no action required).  
- A minor illusory effect is triggered, as though Halaster had cast [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md) in an area. Common illusions include the echo of rattling chains, the distant sound of explosive spells being cast, a dusty cloak or a rusty helm floating as though worn by an [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) figure, and illusory footprints appearing on a dusty floor.  
- Silent apparitions of dead adventurers drift through halls and rooms as though they are lost. An apparition can't be harmed, and it doesn't acknowledge creatures or objects in any way. It can't be dispelled but is suppressed within an [antimagic field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md).
