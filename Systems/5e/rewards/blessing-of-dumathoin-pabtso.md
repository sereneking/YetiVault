# Blessing of Dumathoin

Your eyes become keen enough to pick out hidden secrets. You gain [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision). If you already had [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision), you can see in color in the dark. In addition, you can use an action to gain [truesight](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#truesight) for 1 minute. Once you gain [truesight](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#truesight) in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
