`dice: [](purphoross-villains-mot.md#^purphoross-villains)`

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [cult fanatic](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) of Purphoros turns to Mogis to enhance his craft, engaging in bloody rituals to produce exquisite cursed weapons. |
| 2 | An aging [veteran](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) seeks to replace her body with living bronze and enlists a genius [archmage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) of Purphoros to aid her. Then several of their test limbs escape. |
| 3 | A rebel ([spy](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/spy.md)) plots to set fire to a temple of Heliod and dedicate the blaze to Purphoros, driving the gods toward a conflict he's certain Purphoros will win. |
| 4 | A [gladiator](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md) of Purphoros partakes of the fumes at Mount Velus then goes on what seems to be a rampage that contributes to a mysterious design. |
| 5 | A [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Purphoros condemns the party for treating their weapons and tools poorly, insisting they discard them until the heroes prove their worthiness. |
| 6 | A group of [oreads](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/oread-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks inspiration in flames. The oreads leave Purphoros's forge and conduct thorough studies of everything they burn. |
