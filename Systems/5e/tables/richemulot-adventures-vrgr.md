|----------|-----------|
| 1 | At the command of Jacqueline Renier, [swarms of rats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md) nightly slip into homes and murder the resident cats. Distraught pet owners entreat the characters for aid. |
| 2 | A desperate rogue seeks the characters' aid when the rest of her band is trapped within the abandoned Fiox Estate by a haywire security system. |
| 3 | A band of students plot a revolution against Jacqueline Renier in the valley called Assassin's Echo. They're convinced one among them is a traitor but don't realize there's a [wererat](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) in their midst. |
| 4 | A constable requests the characters' aid in solving murders in which the victims have been drained of blood. The murderer is a [strigoi](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/strigoi-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5") that haunts a sunken chapel in the swamp known as the Gardens. |
| 5 | Doctor Temator of Mortigny believes she can create a cure for the Gnawing Plague and enlists the characters to find subjects who have never had the disease. Rumors soon spread that the doctor and characters are actually spreading the plague. |
| 6 | Louise Renier seeks the characters' aid in infiltrating a ball Jacqueline is holding at Chateau Delanuit. She aims to infuriate Jacqueline so that she reveals her [wererat](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) nature before her guests. |
