|----------|----------------|
| 1 | [Gnolls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md) lairing in the fort have been attacking caravans and travelers near the Darguun border. But the gnolls are mercenaries. Who are they working for? |
| 2 | The ruins are said to hold a powerful magic item that was used by the ancient Dhakaani goblins against the daelkyr. |
| 3 | The party is hired to recruit several [hill giants](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/hill-giant.md) for a building project in western Breland. Step one is making sure the giants lairing in the fort don't kill the party; step two is persuading them to work for humans. |
| 4 | The characters must rescue prisoners being held by the monsters in the ruins. |
| 5 | A group of Brelish humans determined to "take Brelish lands back from the monsters" have settled and started rebuilding the ruined fort. The party is asked to help them defend the fortâ€”or to protect them as they flee back to Breland, pursued by angry Droaamites. |
| 6 | A Brelish noble hires the party to retrieve a family heirloom lost in the fort's ruins. |
