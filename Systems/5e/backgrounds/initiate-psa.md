# Initiate
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 8*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)  
- **Equipment.** A simple puzzle box, a scroll containing the basic teachings of the five gods, a gaming set, a set of [common clothes](/Systems/5e/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 15 gp. If you have completed any trials before the start of the campaign, you also have any cartouches you have earned  

You are an initiate, on the path to completing the trials of the five gods in the hope of earning a glorified death in the final Trial of Zeal. Some combination of your natural aptitude, your crop's needs, and your teachers' assessment while you were an acolyte led you to focus your training in one particular area of specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or spellcasting. But only a well-rounded initiate can be called truly worthy of the afterlife.

If you are a hand-to-hand specialist, consider the [barbarian](/Systems/5e/classes/barbarian.md), [fighter](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter.md), [monk](/Systems/5e/classes/monk.md), [paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md), or [rogue](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue.md) classes. As a long-range combat specialist, you might be a [fighter](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter.md), a [ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md), or a [rogue](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue.md). If you are a spellcasting specialist, you might be a [bard](/Systems/5e/classes/bard.md), [sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), or [wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md). And beyond this initial choice, you might consider multiclassing or using feats to round out your skills in all three areas.

## Feature: Trials of the Five Gods

Your life is oriented around your participation in the five trials that will determine your worthiness in the afterlife. While you prepare for and undergo those trials, you have constant access to training. A comfortable place to live and regular meals are provided to you by servitor mummies (the anointed) under the supervision of viziers. You can enjoy these benefits only as long as you obey the societal norms of Naktamun—training for the trials (with or without your crop), obeying the orders of the gods, and following the instructions of their viziers. If you violate these norms, you risk being treated as a dissenter. See ""Trials of the Five Gods"" for more information about undertaking the trials and their rewards.

## Suggested Characteristics

An initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight—the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.

| 8 | I'm constantly sizing up everyone around me, thinking about what kind of opponent they'll be in the final trial. |
