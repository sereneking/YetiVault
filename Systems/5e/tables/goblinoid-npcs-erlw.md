**Goblinoid NPCs**

`dice: [](goblinoid-npcs-erlw.md#^goblinoid-npcs)`

| dice: d8 | NPC |
|----------|-----|
| 1 | A hobgoblin bard of the Kech Volaar leads an elite team of dungeon delvers to recover Dhakaani artifacts from ancient ruins. |
| 2 | A remarkably intelligent goblin studying at Arcanix or Morgrave is actually a Khesh'dar spy identifying tomes of arcane knowledge worth stealing. |
| 3 | A Dhakaani strike force assaults a museum or a noble's private holdings, reclaiming goblin artifacts "pillaged" from ruins. These relics could be part of an eldritch machine, or could simply have important ceremonial value. |
| 4 | A goblin spy stirs up trouble among the city goblins in a major city, using tales of their former glory to incite them to violence. |
| 5 | A string of mysterious bombings are actually the work of Dhakaani sappers testing the strength of modern fortifications. |
| 6 | A Dhakaani strike force attacks a Deneith outpost built atop a goblin ruin. Are the goblins just angry about the desecration, or is something hidden beneath the outpost? |
| 7 | A bugbear of the Kech Sharaat, to test the mettle of the adventurers, engages them in a series of guerrilla attacks as they are traveling through the wilderness. |
| 8 | A hobgoblin warlock seeks to harness the power of the daelkyr or the fiendish overlords to win the imperial crown for her kech. |
