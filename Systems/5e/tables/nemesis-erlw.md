*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 91* 

**Nemesis**

`dice: [](nemesis-erlw.md#^nemesis)`

| dice: d6 | Nemesis |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Necromancer**. You lost a lot of friends in battle, but what made it worse was watching that cackling wizard raise them as zombies and turn them against you. |
| 2 | **Camp Commandant**. As prisoners of war, you were captured and subjected to brutal conditions in a prisoner camp. The commandant delighted in your pain. |
| 3 | **Inept Commander**. Your friends would still be alive if one incompetent officer with political power and influential allies hadn't sent you on a disastrous mission. |
| 4 | **Colossus**. You were among those who survived an encounter with a warforged colossus. Cyre or House Cannith—whoever was responsible for such a nightmare—deserves whatever evil fate comes their way. |
| 5 | **Mercenaries**. A band of traitorous mercenaries who switched sides, turning the battle against you. |
| 6 | **Champion**. One mighty hero fought on the enemy side, wielding powerful magic and cruel strategies against the rank-and-file soldiers on your side. |
