**Mogis's Divine Schemes**

`dice: [](mogiss-divine-schemes-mot.md#^mogiss-divine-schemes)`

| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A champion of Mogis unites the [minotaur](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) bands and [cyclops](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) tribes of Phoberos under her banner, creating a terrifying army. At Mogis's command, she leads the army in an all-out assault on Akros, hoping to draw Iroas into battle and defeat him once and for all. |
| 2 | Mogis bargains with Pharika, convincing her to create elixirs that will turn his followers into invincible monsters. He sends his champions to fetch the necessary ingredients for her. |
| 3 | A bitter noble makes a pact with Mogis for power in exchange for carrying out a plot to ignite a war between Meletis and Setessa. Thousands will die unless the scheme is put to rest. |
| 4 | Mogis agrees to ally with three other gods against their rivals if they help him defeat Iroas. Mogis's brother does the same. Soon the entire pantheon divides along faction lines and prepare for the final war. |
