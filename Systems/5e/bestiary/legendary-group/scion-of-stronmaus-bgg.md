# Scion of Stronmaus

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Stronmaus is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Elemental Portals.** Two-way portals to the Elemental Plane of Air (if the scion is in the sky) or the Elemental Plane of Water (if the scion is in the ocean) form within 1 mile of the cradle or scion, allowing elemental creatures into the world.  
- **Empowered Storm Giants.** Storm giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +8 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  
- **Extreme Weather.** The weather within 1 mile of the scion dramatically shifts day to day, ranging from pleasantly sunny to brutal hailstorms.  

If the scion dies, these effects end immediately.
