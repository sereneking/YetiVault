**Falling in Sharn**

`dice: [](watch-your-step-falling-in-sharn-erlw.md#^falling-in-sharn)`

| dice: d8 | Result |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You fall hundreds of feet before striking the ground at the base of the towers. |
| 2 | You fall `3d6 × 10` feet before striking a bridge. A major bridge in an upper or a middle ward will have a [feather fall](/Systems/5e/spells/feather-fall.md) enchantment; otherwise, it's going to be a hard landing. |
| 3 | You fall `2d4 × 10` feet and land in a passing skycoach, possibly injuring a passenger. |
| 4 | You fall `4d4 × 5` feet and strike an outcropping, flagpole, or projecting statue. If you survive, you're still precariously perched on the edge of a tower or bridge. |
| 5 | You fall past a [hippogriff](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/hippogriff.md)—make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to catch its leg! |
| 6 | A [gargoyle](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) or [giant owl](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-owl.md) catches you—then threatens to drop you if it doesn't get a reward. |
| 7 | You can fly! Actually, a nearby wizard or artificer casts [feather fall](/Systems/5e/spells/feather-fall.md) to save you, but for a moment it felt like you can fly. And now the spellcaster wants payment. |
| 8 | You strike a small [air elemental](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/air-elemental.md) that was drawn to the city. Doing this cushions your fall, but now you're on top of an air elemental. |
