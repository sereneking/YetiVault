# Shadowfell Brand Tattoo
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


This tattoo is dark in color and abstract. While it's on your skin, you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks.

## Shadowy Defense

When you take damage, you can use your reaction to become shadowy and insubstantial for a moment, reducing the damage you take by half. Once used, this reaction can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Tattoo Attunement

To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you.
