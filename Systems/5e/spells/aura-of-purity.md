Each nonhostile creature in the aura (including you) can't become diseased, has resistance to poison damage, and has advantage on saving throws against effects that cause any of the following conditions: [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned).
