## Traits

***Reduced Threat.*** A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies), saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and saving throw DCs (included in the stat block).

***Limited Telepathy.*** The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`1d8`) piercing damage.
