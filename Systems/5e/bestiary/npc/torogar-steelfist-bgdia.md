## Traits

***Goring Rush.*** Immediately after using the Dash action, Torogar can make one melee attack with his horns.

***Labyrinthine Recall.*** Torogar can perfectly recall any path he has traveled.

***Rage (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, Torogar can enter a rage that lasts for 1 minute. The rage ends early if Torogar is knocked [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) or if his turn ends and he hasn't attacked a hostile creature or taken damage since his last turn. While raging, Torogar gains the following benefits:

He has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

He deals an extra 3 damage when he hits a target with a melee weapon attack.

He has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

***Special Equipment.*** Torogar wears [gauntlets of flaming fury](/Systems/5e/items/gauntlets-of-flaming-fury-bgdia.md) and a [belt of fire giant strength](/Systems/5e/items/belt-of-fire-giant-strength.md). Without the belt, his Strength is 21. He also carries a [soul coin](/Systems/5e/items/soul-coin-bgdia.md).
