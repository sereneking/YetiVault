**Underworld Crossings Villains**

`dice: [](underworld-crossings-villains-mot.md#^underworld-crossings-villains)`

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [Returned palamnite](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/returned-palamnite-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks to destroy all Underworld crossings so the dead can freely enter the mortal world. |
| 2 | A conquering general captures a number of [Underworld cerberi](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/underworld-cerberus-mot.md) (see "chapter 6"), plotting to unleash the terrifying beasts during a war. |
| 3 | A greedy [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Erebos steals coins from the dead before they are buried, thereby filling a crossing with stranded souls. |
| 4 | A [nightmare shepherd](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/nightmare-shepherd-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") takes over a crossing and doesn't allow souls to pass into the Underworld. As a result, they become [specters](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) that harass the living in the mortal world. |
| 5 | A [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Athreos becomes annoyed with the dead returning and sends armies of clergy to secure the mortal side of the crossing. |
| 6 | A [satyr reveler](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/satyr-reveler-mot.md) (see "chapter 6") seeks to throw an eternal revel! By stealing coins from the dead, the satyr traps souls at his morbid, Tartyx-side bacchanal. |
