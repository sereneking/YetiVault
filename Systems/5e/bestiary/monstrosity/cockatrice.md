# Cockatrice
*Source: Monster Manual p. 42, Tales from the Yawning Portal, Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus, Eberron: Rising from the Last War, Mythic Odysseys of Theros, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs-things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury.
