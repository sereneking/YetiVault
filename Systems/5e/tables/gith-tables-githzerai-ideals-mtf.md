**Githzerai Ideals**

`dice: [](gith-tables-githzerai-ideals-mtf.md#^githzerai-ideals)`

| dice: d4 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Faith. Zerthimon shall return, and I will be worthy to walk beside him. |
| 2 | Courage. The mind can master anything if it is unfettered by fear. |
| 3 | Duty. My people survive only because those like me place their needs above our own. |
| 4 | Freedom. No strong soul should be enslaved. Better to die first than live as another's puppet. |
