# Pact of the Talisman
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 11*  

Your patron gives you a special amulet, a talisman that can aid you, or anyone else who wears it, when the need is great. When the wearer makes an ability check with a skill in which they lack proficiency, they can add a `d4` to the roll.

If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous amulet.

The talisman turns to ash when you die.
