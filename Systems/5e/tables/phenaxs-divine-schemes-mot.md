| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Phenax finds an artifact capable of imprisoning Athreos and engages in a shadow war with Erebos, causing pandemonium in the Underworld. As a result, droves of Returned flood the mortal world. |
| 2 | Phenax undertakes a plot to transform Erebos into one of the Returned. If he succeeds, the balance of life and death will be shattered. |
| 3 | Phenax vanishes. For a time, it's believe the god has been killed or grew bored and left Theros. In fact, though, Phenax managed to imprison another god and has since taken their place. |
| 4 | Phenax dispatches a powerful agent to find a lost relic called Deception's Edge, a dagger that enables the wielder to warp the minds of mortals. Once in possession of the artifact, the agent embarks on a campaign of assassination and espionage that threatens to lead to all-out war between Akros and Meletis. |
