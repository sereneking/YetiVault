# Wurm
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 32*  

The wurms of Zendikar are gigantic creatures with features akin to both snakes and insects. A wurm's serpentine body is covered in heavy bands of scales, giving it a segmented appearance. Its misshapen head is crowned with at least eight eyes, and is dominated by a ring of four or five enormous, hook-like fangs surrounding the mouth. The creature's jaws extend like a tube out from its mouth when it is ready to feed, accompanied by a horrendous carrion stench and a nauseating squelching sound.

The [purple worm](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) in the Monster Manual is a fine representation of Zendikar's wurms.

## Traits

***Tunneler.*** The wurm can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The wurm makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its stinger.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d8 + 9`) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the wurm. A swallowed creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the wurm, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the wurm's turns.

If the wurm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the wurm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the wurm. If the wurm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Tail Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 19 (`3d6 + 9`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (`12d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
