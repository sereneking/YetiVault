# Lindwyrm Venom
*Potion, very rare*  


This terrible venom is extracted and distilled from the deadly [lindwyrm](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/lindwyrm-ghloe.md). It can be delivered via ingestion or a wound. A creature exposed to the venom must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (`8d8`) poison damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned, the creature has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity skill checks and saving throws.
