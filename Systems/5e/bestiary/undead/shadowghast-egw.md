# Shadowghast
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 299*  

A shadowghast is an undead assassin. Leaping out from the shadows and trailing tendrils of darkness, it closes in on its prey with nary a sound, then tears into a victim with its paralyzing claws and furious bite.

## Traits

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the shadowghast must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this Stench for 24 hours.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the shadowghast can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadowghast makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (`2d8 + 2`) slashing damage plus 5 (`1d10`) necrotic damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
