# Chaos Quadrapod
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 209*  

A cluster of four suckered tentacles with a pulsing mass of ethereal light as its central body, the chaos quadrapod is a creature of the Far Realm, and it channels the anarchic power of that plane as it destroys all in its path. The quadrapod ambulates by flinging its mucus-covered tentacles out and dragging itself along, creating a horrid slurping sound as it advances relentlessly toward its prey.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The chaos quadrapod has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The chaos quadrapod makes up to two tentacle attacks.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The chaos quadrapod can grapple no more than two targets at a time.

***Chaos Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The chaos quadrapod shoots forth a knot of roiling ethereal light that explodes at a point it can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.
