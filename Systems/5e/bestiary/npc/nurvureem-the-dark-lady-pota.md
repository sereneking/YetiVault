## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Nurvureem can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Nurvureem fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Living Shadow.*** While in dim light or darkness, the dragon has resistance to damage that isn't force, psychic, or radiant.

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the dragon can take the [Hide](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the dragon has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Nurvureem can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) necrotic damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Nurvureem's choice that is within 120 feet of Nurvureem and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Nurvureem's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Nurvureem exhales necrotic in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** Nurvureem makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** Nurvureem makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** Nurvureem beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of Nurvureem must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (`2d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). Nurvureem can then fly up to half its flying speed.
