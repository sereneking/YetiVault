**Boss Assignments**

`dice: [](boss-assignments-bgg.md#^boss-assignments)`

| dice: d6 | Assignment |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | Thieves stole the giant's most precious treasure and fled into the sewers, where the giant can't follow. Hunt the thieves and retrieve the treasure. |
| 2 | A rival gang is encroaching on the giant's territory. Spy on these rivals, and identify the best place for the giant to strike to shut them down for good. |
| 3 | Somebody who works for the giant is stealing. Find out who it is, and make sure they never think about double-crossing the giant again. |
| 4 | The giant has a score to settle with a powerful foe (perhaps a dragon, a [beholder](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md), or another monstrous crime lord). Make sure the boss survives! |
| 5 | The boss wants a treasure that's being held in an underground refuge the giant can't enter. Plan and execute the perfect heist. |
| 6 | Another group of adventurers refuses to serve the boss anymore. Find them and convince them to return, or join forces with them to topple the giant. |
