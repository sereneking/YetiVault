# Gambler's Blade
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


Choose a magical bonus of +1 to +3. This sword gains that bonus to its attack and damage rolls. For each point of bonus you choose for the sword, you take a corresponding penalty (−1 to −3) to your death saving throws. You can change this magical bonus each day at dawn.

## Curse

This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. Until the curse is broken with a [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic, you are unwilling to part with the weapon.
