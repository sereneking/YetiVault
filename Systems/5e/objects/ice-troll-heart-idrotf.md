## Heart Effects

An ice troll's heart remains cold even after the troll's destruction. As long as the troll can't regenerate, its heart can be safely removed from its remains, handled, and kept. An ice troll's heart, once removed, becomes a harmless Tiny object. For the next 24 hours, the heart has the following magical properties:

- A creature that eats the heart gains the ability to regenerate for the next 24 hours, regaining 5 hit points at the start of each of its turns. If the creature takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of its next turn. The creature dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.  
- If buried in the ground under a foot or more of earth, the heart melts away and summons a blizzard like that created by the [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) spell. It takes 10 minutes for the heart to melt and the blizzard to form. The blizzard lasts for 8 hours.  
- A hag or similar creature can perform a ritual that turns the heart into a magical talisman that acts like a patch of brown mold (see "[Brown Mold](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/brown-mold.md)" in the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). This effect lasts until the heart is destroyed.  
- A creature proficient with alchemist's supplies can squeeze enough residual fluid out of the heart to mix with other alchemical ingredients, creating one [potion of resistance (cold)](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-cold-resistance.md). It takes 1 hour to create this potion.
