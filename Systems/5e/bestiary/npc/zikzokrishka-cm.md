# Zikzokrishka
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 209*  

## Zikzokrishka's Phylactery

Zikzokrishka hid her phylactery deep within the Scimitar Spires, a mountain range to the east of the necropolis of Azumar. If the characters defeat her, Zikzokrishka uses her phylactery to rematerialize, having long ago prepared a dragon's corpse to house her spirit upon its return to the phylactery.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Zikzokrishka fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Zikzokrishka has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Zikzokrishka can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d10 + 7`) piercing damage plus 5 (`1d10`) lightning damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d6 + 7`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d8 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Zikzokrishka's choice that is within 120 feet of the Zikzokrishka and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Zikzokrishka's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Zikzokrishka exhales lightning in a 90-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (`12d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** Zikzokrishka makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** Zikzokrishka makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** Zikzokrishka beats its tattered wings. Each creature within 10 feet of Zikzokrishka must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (`2d6 + 7`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). After beating its wings this way, Zikzokrishka can fly up to half its flying speed.
