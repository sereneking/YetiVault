The next time you hit with a melee weapon attack during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra `1d6` psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the spell ends. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom check against your spell save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.

**Classes**: [Paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md), [Warlock (The Hexblade)](/Systems/5e/classes/warlock-the-hexblade-xge.md)
