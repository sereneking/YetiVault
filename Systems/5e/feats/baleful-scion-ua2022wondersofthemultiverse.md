# Baleful Scion
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You can channel cosmic forces of evil that cause pain but invigorate your being. You can choose your own actions despite this malign connection. You gain the following benefits:

- **Life-Draining Grasp.** Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can also deal necrotic damage to it. The damage equals `1d6` + your proficiency bonus, and you regain a number of hit points equal to this necrotic damage dealt. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
