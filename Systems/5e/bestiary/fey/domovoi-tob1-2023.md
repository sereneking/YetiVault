# Domovoi
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 108*  

*The creature resembles a large, stony goblin, with an oversized head and leering grin. It has a mossy beard, massive shoulders, and long forearms.*

## Abandoned Servants

The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and when elves leave a place, the domovoi are often left behind. Some say the domovoi are left on purpose, while others say the domovoi are too attached to their homes to follow the elves to far-flung locales.

## Debt Collectors

These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers, and they enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.

> [!note] Domovoi in Midgard
> 
> The domovoi are ancient survivors, and they have outlived empires. They now have a certain sense of ownership of ancient places. They most commonly dwell in the ruins of Old Valera and Old Thorn, as well as the vast necropoli of Spintarra and Siwal. The Siwalese Fey are sandier in appearance and have beards of rope and twine. These desert domovoi are known as "pa'athara" in Siwalese.

## Traits

***House Guardian.*** When the domovoi finishes a long rest in a structure with up to 2,500 square feet of floor space, the structure becomes magically protected. This works like the [guards and wards](/Systems/5e/spells/guards-and-wards.md) spell, except the domovoi can choose only two effects from the spell to place in the warded area.

***Spellcasting.*** The domovoi casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**At will**: [alter self](/Systems/5e/spells/alter-self.md)

**3/day each**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The domovoi makes two Slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Invisibility.*** The domovoi magically turns [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until it attacks or casts a spell, or until its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the domovoi wears or carries is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with it.

## Bonus Actions

***Protector's Step.*** The domovoi magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space within a structure protected by its House Guardian trait or within 30 feet of the exterior of that structure. Swirls of golden light, sparkles of starlight, or tendrils of inky shadow (the domovoi's choice) appear at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
