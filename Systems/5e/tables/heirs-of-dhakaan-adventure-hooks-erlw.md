| 1 | A scout patrol has gone missing near the border of Darguun. |
| 2 | A mining tunnel has collapsed, revealing a network of caverns leading into Khyber. The Heirs of Dhakaan are waiting in the darkness and decide to strike first. |
| 3 | A squad of goblins attempts to steal back spoils of a recent adventure, cursing the characters for being grave robbers. |

| 6 | Defend a series of temples against Dhakaani raiders targeting these "houses of false gods." |
| 7 | Explorers discover a fragment of an ancient Dhakaani song that seems to tell of the true heir of Dhakaan. The complete lyrics might settle the question of succession. |
