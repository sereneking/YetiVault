# Quandrix Pledgemage
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 208*  

The students of Quandrix College—first as apprentices and then as pledgemages—immerse themselves in the magic of geometry and metaphysics. Their ultimate goal isn't mastery, however. Rather, in their projects they explore and expand knowledge without expecting concrete answers. Whether students are extrapolating mathematical patterns in nature or engaging in speculative dives into topological formulas that bend reality, their studies blur the line between abstract numerical theory and natural reality.

## Quandrix Scholars

The scholars of Quandrix College focus on the mathematical principles that govern reality. Through these formulas, they can manipulate properties of matter and space, as well as abstract and conceptual space such as the mind, probability, and the flow of magic itself.

***Spellcasting.*** The pledgemage casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**At will**: [guidance](/Systems/5e/spells/guidance.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1/day each**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [enlarge/reduce](/Systems/5e/spells/enlarge-reduce.md), [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md), [plant growth](/Systems/5e/spells/plant-growth.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The pledgemage makes two Exponential Lash attacks.

***Exponential Lash.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) force damage, and the pledgemage can cause one creature it can see within 30 feet of the target to take 10 (`2d6 + 3`) force damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Vortex Calculus (Recharge 4-6).*** The pledgemage teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of itself. Immediately after it teleports, each creature within 20 feet of the space it left must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (`2d6`) force damage and is moved 10 feet in a random horizontal direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't moved.
