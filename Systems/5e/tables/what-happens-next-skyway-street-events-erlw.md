|-----------|-------|
| 1 | A few [gargoyles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) perch on a mansion's walls. They're seemingly there for security, but they offer lively commentary about everyone who passes by. |
| 2 | A [noble](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md) with auburn hair held in a silver diadem holds a darkwood staff encrusted with dragonshards, and taps it impatiently while waiting for a skycoach. |
| 3 | You pass by a hope well. Supposedly, any coins you throw in the well are gathered and transported down to help the troubled people of the lower wards. |
| 4 | "Make way! Make way!" A boy clears a path for a jewel-encrusted warforged wearing a lavish fur cloak. |
| 5 | You come upon a fountain of cold fire. In the center, a brass dragon spits brilliant flames into the air, and they spill down and out into the surrounding pool. |
| 6 | A team of handlers from House Vadalis walk alongside a small [gelatinous cube](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md). "We're trying it out, seeing if it can help keep things clean," they say. |
| 7 | A [magewright](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/magewright-erlw.md) offers to use a simple charm to polish the coins in your purse for just 3 copper crowns. "We wouldn't want anyone here to get grime on their gloves from handling those filthy coins of yours from the lower wards." |
| 8 | A tour group pauses to marvel at a mansion. |
| 9 | A large statue commemorates Lord Dalian ir'Tain, a noble philanthropist lost at sea at the end of the Last War. He holds a spyglass in one hand and a miniature dragon turtle in the other. |
| 10 | A warforged with roses twined around her limbs offers to sell you a bouquet for five silver sovereigns. |
| 11 | It starts to drizzle. A well-dressed half-elf glares at the sky and snaps his fingers. The rain immediately stops. |
| 12 | A member of the Sharn Watch stops you. "Can I help you? Are you sure you're in the right ward?" |
