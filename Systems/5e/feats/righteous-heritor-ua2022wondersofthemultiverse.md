# Righteous Heritor
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 8*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You can channel the cosmic forces of good that foster serenity and fellowship. You are still free to choose your own actions, but gain these benefits:

- **Soothe Pain.** When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to dull its suffering and reduce the damage it takes by `1d10` + your proficiency bonus. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
