**Exiles**

`dice: [](exiles-bgg.md#^exiles)`

| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Characters get entangled in the affairs of a criminal gang operating in a major city and eventually discover the gang's leader is a giant whose headquarters is a huge warehouse at the city's outskirts. |
| 2 | Adventurers discover a secret cult conducting sinister rites in a vast mansion where a giant lives in luxury. |
| 3 | A giant takes up residence in a city and demands a huge share of tax revenue in exchange for protecting the city from outside threats. |
| 4 | An adventurer receives an exclusive invitation to study a topic of interest (perhaps giants' sagas or religion), but the invitation seems suspicious—demanding secrecy, traveling to a remote place, and so on. The teacher is a giant living near a city who is trying not to attract attention. |
| 5 | A group of adventurers—supplied with superior equipment and information by their giant patron—pursues the same goal as the characters. |
| 6 | A giant who lives in a city asks the characters to take the giant's teenage child with them on their next adventure. (See the ""Giant Children"" sidebar for suggestions on how to represent the teenage giant with a stat block.) |
