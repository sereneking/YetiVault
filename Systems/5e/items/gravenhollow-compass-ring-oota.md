# Gravenhollow Compass Ring
*Other, unknown (magic)*  


This gold ring is fitted with a star ruby worth 1,000 gp. A [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals that the gem radiates a faint aura of divination magic. The gem's star-shaped core is a magical compass that guides the ring's wearer along the safest, shortest route to Gravenhollow.
