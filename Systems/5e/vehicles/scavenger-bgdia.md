## Traits

**Crushing Wheels** The Scavenger can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the creature was already [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), it takes an extra 16 (`3d10`) bludgeoning damage. This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons** The Scavenger's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency** If the Scavenger rolls over and falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until flipped upright.

## Action Stations

**Helm (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Three-Quarters Cover)** Drive and steer the Scavenger.

**Grappling Claw (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover)** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* The target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 12). If the target is a creature, it is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the grapple ends. The grappling claw can grapple only one target at a time, and the claw's operator can use a bonus action to make the claw release whatever it's holding.

**2 Harpoon Flingers (Each Station Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover)** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d8 + 1`) piercing damage.
