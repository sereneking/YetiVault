## Traits

***Animated.*** If the wand lacks legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the wand is securely attached to a surface or larger wand, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0.

When the animated wand drops to 0 hit points, it reverts to its original wand form, and any remaining damage carries over to its original wand form.

The DM might rule that a specific wands slam attack inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

## Actions

***Wand of Wonder.*** The animated wand can expend 1 of its charges and target a random creature with one of its [randomly determined effects](/Systems/5e/items/wand-of-wonder.md). Any such effect that would target the wand's user targets the wand instead. If reduced to 0 hit points, the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.
