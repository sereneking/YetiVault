## Actions

On its turn, the warship can take 3 actions, choosing from the options below. It can take only 2 actions if it has fewer than twenty crew and only 1 action if it has fewer than ten. It can't take these actions if it has fewer than three crew.

- **Fire Mangonels.** The warship can fire its [mangonels](/Systems/5e/objects/mangonel.md) (DMG, ch. 8).  
- **Move.** The warship can use its helm to move with its oars or sails. As part of this move, it can use its naval ram.

## Weapon: Mangonels (2)

- **Armor Class** 15
