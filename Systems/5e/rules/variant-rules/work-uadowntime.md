# Work
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 13* 

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living.

## Resources

Taking on a job requires one workweek of work.

## Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)), Intelligence with a set of tools, Charisma ([Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance)), or Charisma with a [musical instrument](/Systems/5e/items/musical-instrument-scag.md). Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated by the check's total.

**Wages**

| Check Total | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| 9 or less | Poor lifestyle for the week |
| 10 – 14 | Modest lifestyle for the week |
| 15 – 20 | Comfortable lifestyle for the week |
| 21+ | Comfortable lifestyle for the week, +25 gp |

## Complications

Work is rarely filled with enough complications to alter a character's life significantly. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. There is a 10% chance chance per workweek that a character encounters a complication.
