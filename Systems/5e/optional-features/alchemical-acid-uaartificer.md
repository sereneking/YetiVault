# Alchemical Acid
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 5*  

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel, pull out a vial of acid, and hurl the vial at a creature or object within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don't hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). The vial shatters on impact. A creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d6` acid damage. An object automatically takes that damage, and the damage is maximized. This formula's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (`2d6`), 5th level (`3d6`), 7th level (`4d6`), 9th level (`5d6`), 11th level (`6d6`), 13th level (`7d6`), 15th level (`8d6`), 17th level (`9d6`), and 19th level (`10d6`).
