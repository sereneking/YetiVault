`dice: [](pharikas-villains-mot.md#^pharikas-villains)`

| dice: d6 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A [druid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/druid.md) seeds deadly herbs into a village's fields, coaxing the plants to resemble farmers' crops. |
| 2 | The life of a tyrant ([knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/knight.md)) is central to one of Pharika's experiments in mortal suffering, so the god resurrects the tyrant whenever enemies kill him. |
| 3 | Legend tells of a hydra with alchemical lore scribed upon its bones. When an alchemist ([mage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) begins poisoning the beasts, Nylea sends dozens of [hydras](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/hydra.md) to seek revenge, catching innocents in the fray. |
| 4 | A town suffering from a plague seeks a cure from a [cult fanatic](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md) of Pharika engaged in warlike research. The researcher's blessing alleviates the pox but leaves the survivors delusional and violent. |
| 5 | After the characters witness a miracle, an apothecary ([mage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) seeks their blood as a medicinal ingredient. |
| 6 | An [archmage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) devotee of Pharika manages to shrink monsters to a size so small that they effectively behave as viruses. |
