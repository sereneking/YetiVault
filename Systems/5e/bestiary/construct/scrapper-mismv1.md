# Scrapper
*Source: Misplaced Monsters: Volume 1 p. 10*  

> [!note]
> Created by Jake F.

Scrappers are tall, broad-shouldered automatons usually found in scrap yards. Sparks erupt from the loose wires that protrude from their hulking frames. Their quasi-mechanical minds are shielded with lead, protecting them from psychic damage.

A scrapper feeds on scrap metal and uses its electrified wires to grapple and reel in foes. It zaps enemies it can't reach with an energy beam fired from an extended eye.
