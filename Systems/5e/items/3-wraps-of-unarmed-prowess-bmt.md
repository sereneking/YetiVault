# +3 Wraps of Unarmed Prowess
*Wondrous Item, very rare*  


While you're wearing these cloth wraps, your unarmed strikes are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks and damage, and you gain a +3 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes.
