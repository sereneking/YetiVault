# Elder Brain

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an elder brain can take one of the following lair actions; the elder brain can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Force Wall.** The elder brain casts [wall of force](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-force.md).  
- **Psionic Anchor.** The elder brain targets one creature it can sense within 120 feet of it and anchors it by sheer force of will. The target must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, its speed is reduced to 0, and it can't teleport. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Psychic Inspiration.** The elder brain targets one friendly creature it can sense within 120 feet of it. The target has a flash of inspiration and gains advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.  

## Regional effects

The territory within 5 miles of an elder brain is altered by the creature's psionic presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Paranoia.** Creatures within 5 miles of an elder brain feel as if they are being followed, even when they're not.  
- **Psychic Whispers.** Any creature with which the elder brain has formed a psychic link hears faint, incomprehensible whispers in the deepest recesses of its mind. This psychic detritus consists of the elder brain's stray thoughts commingled with those of other creatures to which it is linked.  
- **Telepathic Eavesdropping.** The elder brain can overhear any telepathic conversation within 5 miles of it. The creature that initiated the telepathic conversation makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw when telepathic contact is first established. If the save is successful, the creature is aware that something is eavesdropping. The nature of the eavesdropper isn't revealed.  

If the elder brain dies, these effects immediately end.
