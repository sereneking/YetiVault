| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Wild-eyed people attending a popular new club seem unwilling or unable to go home after several days of nonstop merriment. |
| 2 | One morning, everyone who has seen a [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md) performance in the past week suddenly transforms into a minor demon. |
| 3 | An apparently spontaneous [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md)-led riot has spread to take over an entire neighborhood. |
| 4 | People who die in [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md)-inspired violence stand back up as [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) and keep fighting. |
| 5 | Ordinary knives and chains in homes across the neighborhood seem to come to life in advance of the start of a [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md) show. |
| 6 | After several mausoleums are burst open from the inside, people see their undead family members cavorting on a [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md) stage. |
