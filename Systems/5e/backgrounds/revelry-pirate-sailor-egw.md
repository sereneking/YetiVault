It seems that just about everyone is a sailor on the Menagerie Coast. Plenty of pirates ply the waters of the coast as well, but none are as infamous or as organized as the mighty Revelry. If you're a pirate of the Revelry, you serve the Plank King and return a cut of all your plunder to him on the island of Darktow.

The Revelry doesn't take kindly to traitors and deserters, so if you count yourself a former member of that crew, you'll want to watch your back while traveling on the Menagerie Coast. Thugs might hassle you and your allies until you even the score with the Revelry, either by paying up, submitting to imprisonment, or proving that you're too dangerous to tangle with.

## Feature: Ship's Passage

When you need to, you can secure free passage on a sailing ship for yourself and your adventuring companions. You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship you have good relations with (perhaps one captained by a former crewmate). Because you're calling in a favor, you can't be certain of a schedule or route that will meet your every need. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to assist the crew during the voyage.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.
