# Skull of Selfish Knowledge
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


You may use an action to make the magical skull devour a nonmagical book, map, or scroll. Once devoured the learning is forever available to you, but you can never write the information down or communicate it to others. It is for you alone.
