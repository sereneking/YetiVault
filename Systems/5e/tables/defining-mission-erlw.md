`dice: [](defining-mission-erlw.md#^defining-mission)`

| dice: d6 | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Heroic Stand**. You knew if you took one step back from the line, all would be lost. When relief arrived days later, you had not budged. |
| 2 | **Telling Blow**. The enemy general never knew what hit them. You still carry their personal flag as a trophy. |
| 3 | **Dawn Raid**. You traveled hundreds of miles around enemy lines to reach your target. In a single day, months of enemy preparation went up in flames. |
| 4 | **Break the Line**. During a key battle, you were part of a heroic push to break the enemy line. |
| 5 | **Liberator**. You were at the forefront of a daring assault to liberate a captured citadel or town. |
| 6 | **Sharp Eye**. The enemy's secret attack would've been devastating. Luckily, you spotted it in time. |
