- **Type 1.** Human body with snake head  
- **Type 2.** Human head and body with snakes for arms  
- **Type 3.** Human head and upper body with a serpentine lower body instead of legs  

***Innate Spellcasting (Yuan-ti Form Only).*** Oussa's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). Oussa can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
