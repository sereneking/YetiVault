# Propeller Helm
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a small humanoid)*  


While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md) spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50% chance chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
