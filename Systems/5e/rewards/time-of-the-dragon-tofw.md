# Time of the Dragon
*Charm*  

While holding the scale, you can use an action to summon Renesnuprah, an [adult time dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-time-dragon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). The dragon appears in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of you and aids you for 10 minutes. Afterward, the time dragon vanishes, and the scale crumbles.
