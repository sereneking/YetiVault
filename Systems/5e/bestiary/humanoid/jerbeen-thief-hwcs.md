# Jerbeen Thief
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 200*  

While criminals can often be found picking pockets in large perch cities, only the most successful end up recruited by the Bandit Coalition. Small of stature, jerbeens can easily move about unnoticed; their swiftness is responsible for the expression "quick as a jerbeen." This, coupled with their natural charm, makes jerbeens perfectly suited for the thieving arts.
