# Menga leaves (1 ounce)
*Adventuring Gear, unknown*  

- **Cost**: 2 gp
- **Weight**: 0.0625 lbs.

The dried leaves of a menga bush can be ground, dissolved in a liquid, heated, and ingested. A creature that ingests 1 ounce of menga leaves in this fashion regains 1 hit point. A creature that ingests more than 5 ounces of menga leaves in a 24-hour period gains no additional benefit and must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 hour. The [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) creature awakens if it takes at least 5 damage on one turn.

A healthy menga bush usually has `2d6` ounces of leaves. Once picked, the leaves require 1 day to dry out before they can confer any benefit.
