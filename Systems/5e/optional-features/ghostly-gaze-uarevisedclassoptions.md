# Ghostly Gaze
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts until the end of the current turn. During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images. Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
