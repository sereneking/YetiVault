# Fortune's Favor
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a white pearl worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You impart latent luck to yourself or one willing creature you can see within range. When the chosen creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw before the spell ends, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll an additional `d20` and choose which of the `d20`s to use. Alternatively, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can dismiss this spell on itself to roll a `d20` and choose which of the `d20`s to use, the one it rolled or the one the attacker rolled.

If the original `d20` roll has advantage or disadvantage, the creature rolls the additional `d20` after advantage or disadvantage has been applied to the original roll.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Wizard (Chronurgy Magic)](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard-chronurgy-magic-egw.md), [Wizard (Graviturgy Magic)](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard-graviturgy-magic-egw.md)
