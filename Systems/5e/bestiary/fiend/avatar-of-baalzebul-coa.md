## Traits

***Stench of the Slug.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the avatar must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition until the start of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to this stench for 1 hour.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The avatar makes four Sickening Claw attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with Insect Gorge (if available).

***Sickening Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) slashing damage plus 13 (`3d8`) acid damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by the acid damage taken. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Insect Gorge (Recharge 4-6).*** The avatar disgorges a swarm of biting flies at a point it can see within 300 feet of itself. Each creature within a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 55 (`10d10`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The biting flies persist for 1 minute or until the avatar is slain. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the insects' area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

***Caustic Slimepool (1/Day).*** The avatar causes caustic slime to emanate from itself, covering a 15-foot-radius circle. Each creature within the slime must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or have the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 17). A [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) creature takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of its turn.
