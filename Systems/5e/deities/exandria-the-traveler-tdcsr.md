Over the past few years, rumors of a green-cloaked deity with a wiry frame and fiery red hair have spread across Tal'Dorei and the neighboring continent of "Wildemount". This fey trickster, though not a god, has certainly enjoyed pretending to be one to spread mirthful chaos across the world.

Hundreds of isolated individuals across Tal'Dorei have heard the voice of the Travelerâ€”or they've at least experienced one of his wily pranks. Within the past year, a convention of the Traveler's devotees congregated on the tiny island of Rumblecusp in the "Lucidian Ocean" to exult his name and deeds.

And then, suddenly, he vanished. The tales of a trickster deity that washed across Tal'Dorei trickled to a halt, and a few of his once-devoted worshipers hung up their cloaks in disappointment. Something happened on Rumblecusp that shook the faith of dozens of Traveler-worshipers. Some did not return at all.

But amazingly, even though the divine narrative of the Traveler has been abandoned by all, the Traveler's devoted have only grown in number and gleeful impishness. The current story is remarkably close to the truth: that the Traveler is a mighty lord of the fey. This archfey, known as Artagan to a select few, despises the relentless pressure of celebrity godhood, and just wants to bring joy and freedom from responsibility to all. He still has plenty to learn about mortals, and about when a bit of good, harmless fun becomes not-so-harmless after all.
