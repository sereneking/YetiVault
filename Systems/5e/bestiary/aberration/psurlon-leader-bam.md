# Psurlon Leader
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 45*  

One out of every hundred psurlons is a mutant with two heads, one at each end of its body, and a superior intellect. Other psurlons look to the two-headed ones for leadership.

## Traits

***Aberrant Mind.*** Magic can't read the psurlon's thoughts or put the psurlon to sleep.

***Two Heads.*** The psurlon has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid or end the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned), or [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) condition on itself. While one of the psurlon's heads is asleep, its other head is awake.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The psurlon casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**1/day each**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md)

**2/day each**: [disguise self](/Systems/5e/spells/disguise-self.md), [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The psurlon makes two Bite attacks and two Claw attacks. It can also use Pacify (if available) or Psychic Crush.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Pacify (Recharge 5-6).*** The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 10 minutes. The condition ends if the target takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the target awake.

***Psychic Crush.*** The psurlon targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (`3d10 + 5`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
