# Red Ruin
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 208*  

Known for her incredible awareness and reflexes, the dragonnel-flying ace Red Ruin leads the Red Dragon Army's airborne forces. Her actual name is unknown, leading her allies to refer to her merely as "commander" or "Red Ruin"â€”a sobriquet earned after razing numerous targets from the air. She rarely removes her distinctive dragonnel-shaped helmet, leading to speculation about her actual identity. She also speaks little, relying on sharp hand gestures to direct dragonnel-riders in flight.

## Traits

***Draconic Devotion.*** While Red Ruin can see a Dragon that isn't hostile to her, she has advantage on attack rolls.

***Mounted Combat Master.*** When Red Ruin is mounted and a creature targets her mount with an attack, Red Ruin can cause the attack to target her instead.

***Mounted Evasion.*** When Red Ruin or her mount makes a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage from an effect, they take no damage on a success and half damage on a failure.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Red Ruin makes three Ember Lance attacks.

***Ember Lance.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`1d12 + 4`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Explosive Hand Crossbow (Recharge 5-6).*** Red Ruin fires an explosive crossbow bolt at a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. When the bolt reaches that point, or if it hits an object early, it detonates in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
