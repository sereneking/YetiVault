# Aurnozci

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Aurnozci can take one of the following lair actions; Aurnozci can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Cocoon.** Aurnozci targets one Medium or smaller creature it can see within 60 feet of itself and encases the creature in a constricting cocoon. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or have the restrained condition for 1 minute. A target that starts its turn restrained in this way takes 9 (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage. A creature can use its action to try to tear apart the cocoon, ending the cocoon's effect with a successful DC 23 Strength (Athletics) check.  
- **Insect Swarm.** Aurnozci creates a 30-foot-radius sphere of stinging wasps centered on a point within 300 feet of itself. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for 10 minutes or until Aurnozci uses this lair action again. The sphere's area is heavily obscured and is difficult terrain. When the sphere appears, each creature in it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (`3d10`) piercing damage and 16 (`3d10`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the sphere's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.  

## Regional effects


Xulregg is an oppressively muggy realm known for the following regional effects:

- **Boiling Water.** Bodies of water on Xulregg perpetually boil, and even bottled liquids steam when exposed to the layer's atmosphere. Being immersed in water there doesn't confer resistance to fire damage, and a creature that starts its turn in water takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage. A creature that imbibes a liquid (such as a potion) takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage.  
- **Fast Metamorphosis.** On Xulregg, eggs, larvae, and pupae all develop and metamorphose at ten times their usual rate, regardless of sustenance or any other growing conditions.  

If Aurnozci dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
