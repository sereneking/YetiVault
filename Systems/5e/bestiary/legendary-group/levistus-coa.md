# Levistus

## Regional effects
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

The icy regions containing Levistus' lair is corrupted by his presence, which creates the following effect:

- **Frozen Landscape.** Any creature that has the prone or unconscious conditions within 1 mile of the lair, takes 21 (`6d6`) cold damage at the start of their turn.  

If Levistus dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Levistus can take one lair action to cause the following effect or one from the archdevil lair action list (page 214); he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Icemaw.** One creature within 60 feet of Levistus, that he can see, must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. If a creature fails the saving throw, they sink half of their height into the ice and have the grappled condition (escape DC 21) and their movement becomes 0. If a creature already affected by Icemaw is affected by it a second time, they sink completely into the ice and begin suffocating.  

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The [Summoned Underlings](/Systems/5e/tables/archdevil-lair-action-list-summoned-underlings-coa.md) table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
