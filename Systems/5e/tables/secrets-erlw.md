| 1 | **Blackmail Material**. You have evidence of a career-ending secret concerning an important figure. |
| 2 | **Hidden Agenda**. You are party to a conspiracy that seeks to influence events to better suit your desires. |
| 3 | **Careful Balance**. You have damning information on your patron agency, but it has carefully collected equally damaging secrets on all of you. |
| 4 | **Conspiracy**. A local organization, such as a guild, government, or dragonmarked house, is engaged in dirty deeds, and you have inside information on them. |
| 5 | **Deep Cover**. You know the secret identity of a seemingly innocent but powerful person who would rather remain anonymous. |
| 6 | **Empty Threats**. Rumors say you collect damaging secrets on anyone, and people tread carefully around you as a result. The truth is that your reputation is overblown, so you have your own secret to keep safe. |
