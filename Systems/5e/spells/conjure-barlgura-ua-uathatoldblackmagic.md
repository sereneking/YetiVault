%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You summon a [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) that appears in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) is hostile to all non-demons. Roll initiative for the [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md), which has its own turns. At the start of its turn, it moves toward and attacks the nearest non-demon it can perceive. If two or more creatures are equally near, it picks one at random. If it cannot see any potential enemies, the [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) moves in a random direction in search of foes.

As part of casting the spell, you can scribe a circle on the ground using the blood of an intelligent humanoid slain within the past 24 hours. The circle is large enough to encompass your space. The summoned [barlgura](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/barlgura.md) cannot cross the circle or target anyone in it while the spell lasts.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
