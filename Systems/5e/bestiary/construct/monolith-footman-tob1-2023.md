# Monolith Footman
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 275*  

*A suit of elven parade armor, beautifully ornate but perhaps not terribly functional, stands at attention.*

## Beautiful Construct

Like the monolith champion, a monolith footman is an aesthetic triumph in the construct-builder's craft. Unlike the champion, the footman's visor remains closed, hiding any visage. If anything, form takes a higher priority in the footman than function, since their function is largely to look fine as they stand ready to perform servant's duties for their shadow fey masters.

## More Servant than Warrior

Because it's fashioned as grand armor, the footman looks more ferocious than it is. Its fighting ability is nothing to dismiss, but a secondary function. It's a combination of household servant and watchdog with imposing martial flair. Like the champion, a monolith footman's most alarming power is its ability to replace an opponent with a shadow double. This threat should be taken seriously by strangers to shadow as they weigh the risks of causing trouble in the fey courts.

## Perfect Loyalty

Monolith footmen follow orders to the letter and are unswerving in their loyalty.

## Traits

***Coldfire Weapons.*** The monolith footman's weapon attacks are imbued with blue fey fire and magical. When the footman hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `1d8` cold damage or fire damage (included in the attack), the champion's choice.

***Construct Nature.*** The monolith footman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Simple Construction.*** A critical hit against the footman causes it to burst into pieces and be destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet of the footman must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (`2d4`) bludgeoning damage.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The footman makes two Shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) slashing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) cold damage or fire damage (the footman's choice). If the target is within a fey court or castle, the target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible), silent, and [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute, while an illusory version of the target under the footman's control remains visible and audible. The illusion shouts to the target's allies for a retreat or similar action. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself and destroying the illusory double on a success.
