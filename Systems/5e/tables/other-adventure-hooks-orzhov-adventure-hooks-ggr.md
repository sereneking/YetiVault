| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Newly minted Orzhov coins are inscribed with a magical symbol that binds the spirit of anyone who uses them. |
| 2 | [Indentured spirits](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/indentured-spirit-ggr.md) have been deployed to haunt a location the Orzhov want to keep people away from. |
| 3 | Thrulls (a [servitor thrull](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/servitor-thrull-ggr.md) or [winged thrull](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/winged-thrull-ggr.md)) that have broken free of Orzhov control are causing mischief. |
| 4 | Items appear on the black market that were obviously stolen from an Orzhov vault, but no one admits that the theft has occurred or claims credit. |
| 5 | [Gargoyles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md) perched on structures throughout the city are robbing passersby and delivering their stolen goods to an Orzhov basilica. |
| 6 | An eclipse triggers violent behavior from bound Orzhov spirits. |
