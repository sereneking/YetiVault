# Skylla
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 220*  

Skylla, who sometimes goes by the alias Charmay, forged a warlock's pact with Baba Yaga. It is from this powerful archfey that Skylla draws her magic.

Skylla is spiteful and treacherous, as likely to betray her allies as to help them. She talked Kelek into allowing her to serve as the primary liaison between the League of Malevolence and the Hourglass Coven, claiming her pact with Baba Yaga made her better suited for the role than anyone else. Endelyn Moongrave foresaw that Skylla's allies would turn on her one day and shared this information with the warlock. Skylla reacted to that news by distancing herself from the League of Malevolence, and now she works for Endelyn. Skylla is open to the idea of rejoining the league, but not while Kelek is in charge.

## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** Skylla carries an eldritch staff (see appendix A) with 10 charges. The staff regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`; on a 1, the staff is destroyed.

***Spellcasting.*** Skylla casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**1/day each**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [disguise self](/Systems/5e/spells/disguise-self.md), [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md), [fly](/Systems/5e/spells/fly.md), [hypnotic pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md), [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Skylla makes two Eldritch Staff attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with a use of Spellcasting.

***Eldritch Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+2` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage when used with two hands, and Skylla can expend up to 3 of the staff's charges, dealing an extra 4 (`1d8`) lightning damage for each expended charge.

## Reactions

***Eldritch Escape.*** When Skylla takes damage, she can expend 3 charges of her eldritch staff to turn [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) and teleport, along with any equipment she's wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see. She remains [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until the start of her next turn or until she attacks or casts a spell.
