# Razerblast
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 201*  

A razerblast seethes with hate for the enemies of the fire cult. The razerblast's elemental overlords have replaced its heart with a flaming orb that detonates if the razerblast dies.

Razerblasts remember little of their life before they the power of elemental fire transformed them. Now they follow the orders of the flamewraths and the cult leaders without question. Razerblasts fight confidently because they know that even if they lose, they go out in a blaze of glory.

## Traits

***Searing Armor.*** The razerblast's armor is hot. Any creature grappling the razerblast or [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it takes 5 (`1d10`) fire damage at the end of that creature's turn.

***Shrapnel Explosion.*** When the razerblast drops to 0 hit points, a flaming orb in its chest explodes, destroying the razerblast's body and scattering its armor as shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the razerblast when it explodes must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The razerblast makes three melee attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage, or 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack, plus 3 (`1d6`) fire damage.
