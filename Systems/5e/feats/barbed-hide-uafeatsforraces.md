# Barbed Hide
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 1*  

**Prerequisite**: [Tiefling](/Systems/5e/races/tiefling.md)

One of your ancestors was a barbed devil or other spiky fiend. Barbs protrude from your head. You gain the following benefits:

- As a bonus action, you can cause small barbs to protrude all over your body or cause them to retract. At the start of each of your turns while the barbs are out, you deal `1d6` piercing damage to any creature grappling you or any creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by you.  
- You gain proficiency in the [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.
