# Skyships
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 137* 

Within the "Cloudtop District" lies the "Skyport", a series of landing pads and observation towers that form a raised harbor for docking [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md). These beautiful vessels come in a wide variety of sizes, but generally are built to a similar scale as a coaster merchant ship. [Skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) are held aloft and guided via the levitating power of three or more enchanted crystals, called brumestones, installed along the hull or topside of the ship. The enchantments required to produce and maintain these brumestones is a closely guarded secret by the Alsfarin Union within the Marquesian city of "Ank'Harel", and while the Alsfarin Union does occasionally sell [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) to foreign businesses, they retain absolute control over their maintenanceâ€”and of the total number of [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) in operation.

[Skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) are generally reserved for goods and individuals who require expedient travel without the hassles of sea-faring dangers, but the cost to utilize a [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) is prohibitively expensive for anyone but wildly wealthy merchants and landed nobility, fomenting a sense of elitism in those who often make use of their services. Due to the exclusivity of skyports within major metropolises, few [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) in service will deviate from dedicated shipping routes between major cities.

Purchasing a [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) costs 100,000 gp, and requires a personal connection with the Alsfarin Union in "Ank'Harel". A [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) travels at a top speed of 10 miles per hour, can carry total cargo of 10 tons, and requires a crew of six to ten humanoids to operate at peak performance. Most [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) have maximum accommodations for up to 30 passengers. Most [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) only travel between existing skyports (see ""Emon Skyport"," below), and charge a fee of 2 gp per mile for a passenger ticket. Chartering a [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) to a destination off the standard sky routes costs 15 gp per mile, if the captain is available and willing to undertake the journey. Shipping cargo costs 1 gp per mile per 100 pounds of cargo along normal sky routes, and twice that to other destinations.
