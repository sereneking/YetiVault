# Grung Wildling
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 150, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 157*  

Gifted with druidic magic, a grung wildling typically serves as an advisor, a healer, and a nurturer of crops.

## Grungs

Grungs are frog-like folk found in rain forests and tropical jungles. These amphibians prefer shade and live in trees, but they maintain hatcheries for their offspring in well-guarded ground-level pools. About three months after hatching, a grung tadpole takes on the shape of an adult, and after another six months, the grung reaches maturity.

Born in a wide range of colors, grungs most often appear in shades of green, blue, purple, red, orange, and gold. All grungs secrete a substance that is harmless to them but poisonous to other creatures, and sometimes that substance has a special effect based on the grung's color (see "Variant: Grung Poison"). They also use this venom to poison their weapons.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Water Dependency.*** If the grung isn't immersed in water for at least 1 hour during a day, it suffers 1 level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) at the end of that day. The grung can recover from this [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) only through magic or by immersing itself in water for at least 1 hour.

***Spellcasting.*** The grung casts one of the following spells, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md)

**2/day**: [plant growth](/Systems/5e/spells/plant-growth.md)

**3/day each**: [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md), [spike growth](/Systems/5e/spells/spike-growth.md)
