# Telepathic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard p. 8*  

You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the following list: [Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion).  
- You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. If it understands at least one language, it can respond to you telepathically.
