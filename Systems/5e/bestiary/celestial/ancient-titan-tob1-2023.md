# Ancient Titan
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 361*  

*Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharp-edged features that seem hewn from ancient stone.*

## Children of the Gods

Ancient titans are the surviving immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.

## Sea God's Servants

A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand sixty feet tall and weigh over twenty tons.

## Friends to Dragons

Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind dragons and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.

## Primordial Power

The children of an ancient god, titans have a measure of the god's power. They know and command primordial words that can influence the world and creatures around them by tapping into the energy that created the world.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The ancient titan can breathe air and water.

***Magic Resistance.*** The ancient titan has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ancient titan can use its Reality-Altering Words. It then makes two Greatsword attacks or three Word of Pain attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (`8d6 + 8`) slashing damage.

***Word of Pain.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (`4d8 + 5`) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn as pain courses through its body.

***Reality-Altering Words.*** The titan speaks a phrase that temporarily reshapes reality around it, warping the terrain, displacing creatures, and disrupting magic. Each creature within 30 feet of the titan must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be pulled or pushed up to 25 feet toward or away from the titan (the titan's choice) and knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). Instead of pushing or pulling a creature that failed the saving throw, the titan can end one magical effect of its choice of 4th level or lower on that creature. The area then becomes difficult terrain until the start of the titan's next turn. Moving through this difficult terrain doesn't cost the titan extra movement.

***Stunning Word (Recharge 5-6).*** The titan speaks a brief, echoing word of power at up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 45 (`10d8`) force damage and is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
