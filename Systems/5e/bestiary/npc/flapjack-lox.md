## Traits

***Advanced Telepathy.*** Flapjack can perceive the content of any telepathic communication used within 60 feet of it, and it can't be [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) by creatures with any form of telepathy.

***Prone Deficiency.*** If Flapjack is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), roll a die. On an odd result, Flapjack lands upside-down and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). At the end of each of its turns, Flapjack can make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, righting itself and ending the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition if it succeeds.

***Telepathic Shroud.*** Flapjack is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as all divination spells.

***Spellcasting.*** Flapjack casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 12):

**At will**: [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1/day each**: [magic missile](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-missile.md), [unseen servant](/Systems/5e/spells/unseen-servant.md)

## Actions

***Tendrils.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage plus 2 (`1d4`) acid damage. At the end of each of its turns, the target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (`1d4`) acid damage on a failure or ending the recurring acid damage on a success. A [lesser restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/lesser-restoration.md) spell cast on the target also ends the recurring acid damage.

***Stench Spray (1/Day).*** Each creature in a 15-foot cone originating from Flapjack must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be coated in a foul-smelling liquid. A coated creature exudes a horrible stench for `1d4` hours. The coated creature is [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) as long as the stench lasts, and other creatures are [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) while with in 5 feet of the coated creature. A creature can remove the stench on itself by using a short rest to bathe in water, alcohol, or vinegar.
