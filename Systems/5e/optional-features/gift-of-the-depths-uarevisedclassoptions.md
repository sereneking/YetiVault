*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed. You can also cast [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md) without expending a spell slot. Once you cast it using this invocation, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
