| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Several [cyclopes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) refuse to let the characters pass through a region where they're constructing a massive ring of beautifully carved standing stones. |
| 2 | An [ettin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/ettin.md) influenced by "the Beastlands" has one head with bovine features and one head with lupine features. It desperately needs help finding something both heads are willing to eat. |
| 3 | A [storm giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) seeks the characters' help in finding an offering of significant worth and size to impress the god Annam. |
| 4 | A jade-skinned [oni](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/oni.md) from Bytopia has become separated from the spirit she was bound to protect. She requests aid in catching up to her lost ward. |
