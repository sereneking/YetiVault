# Virruza
*Source: Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen p. 119*  

Changed by days of strange experiments involving draconian blood and exposure to the Spawning Shard, Virruza now looks like a tumescent draconian with warty green skin and an overly large mouth.

## Traits

***Death Throes.*** When Virruza is reduced to 0 hit points, he turns into a puddle of acid and splashes acid on those around him. Each creature within 5 feet of him must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for 1 minute. A creature can use its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 7 (`2d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Magic Resistance.*** Virruza has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** Virruza regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Virruza's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). Virruza can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1/day**: [fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md)

**2/day each**: [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Virruza makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws or staff. Alternatively, it uses its Hurl Flame twice.

***Bite (Slaad Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Claw (Slaad Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Hurl Flame.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. The fire ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
