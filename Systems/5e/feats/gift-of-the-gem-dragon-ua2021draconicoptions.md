# Gift of the Gem Dragon
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2021 Draconic Options p. 5*  

You've manifested some of the power of gem dragons, granting you the following benefits:

- When you take damage from a creature that is within 10 feet of you, you can use your reaction to emanate telekinetic energy. The creature that dealt damage to you must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or take `2d8` force damage and be pushed 10 feet away from you. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
