Only about a year ago, a genie of elemental water was freed from captivity beneath Nicodranas—a city in "Wildemount", on the other side of the "Lucidian Ocean". This marid, named Kedive Xundi, has now returned to his Palace of Silver Silt on the Elemental Plane of Water, and is happy to remain there—but he is itching for payback.

But that's a continent away, and Xundi has time for both payback and entertainment. While he manipulates mortals on "Wildemount's" Menagerie Coast, he also has deposited a beautiful clay amphora in the port city of "Stilben". Through this item, he watches passersby, occasionally enticing foolish mortals to pick it up and give it a rub. From there, Xundi offers them power, with no strings attached—save for a request for them to go on the most thrilling adventures a little mortal can. And maybe, if they survive long enough and become powerful enough, the marid will invite that mortal and their friends to his Palace of Silver Silt for a grand banquet, all the pleasures they can imagine, and then a request for them to engage in the most thrilling adventure he can think of—and Xundi has had the length of a most interminable imprisonment to think of incredible adventures.
