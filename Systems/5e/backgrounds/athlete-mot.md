# Athlete
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 31*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)  
- **Languages.** One of your choice  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** Vehicles (land)  
- **Equipment.** A bronze discus or leather ball, a lucky charm or past trophy, a set of [traveler's clothes](/Systems/5e/items/travelers-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp  

You strive to perfect yourself physically and in execution of everything you do. The thrill of competition lights fire in your blood, and the roar of the crowd drives you forward. Tales of your exploits precede you and might open doors or loosen tongues.

Whether in one of the poleis, between them, or among the nonhuman peoples of Theros, physical contests and those who pursue them command respect bordering on reverence. Athletes arise from all walks of life and all cultures and quite often cross paths with one another.

## Feature: Echoes of Victory

You have attracted admiration among spectators, fellow athletes, and trainers in the region that hosted your past athletic victories. When visiting any settlement within 100 miles of where you grew up, there is a 50% chance chance you can find someone there who admires you and is willing to provide information or temporary shelter.

Between adventures, you might compete in athletic events sufficient enough to maintain a comfortable lifestyle, as per the ""Practicing a Profession"" downtime activity in chapter 8 of the "Player's Handbook".
