# Queen of Night and Magic
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 178*  

*A fey lady of stunning beauty with hair the color of midnight stands before a shining field of stars. A gown seemingly woven from the night sky drapes her flawless ivory skin. Bright lights glitter like diamonds in her crown and raiment, and some drift about her body and dance near her hand*.

Her Celestial and Royal Majesty, Sarastra Aestruum, Queen of Night and Magic, is also Duchess of the Heavens, Mistress of Air and Darkness, Lady of the Summer Palace, and Bride of Shadows. The Queen rules the court of the shadow fey with grace and majesty—most of the time. Queen Sarastra is the head of the Summer Court, which rules the shadow fey in its season. On the rare occasion when the courtly season turns, Sarastra steps aside in favor of her husband and rival, the Moonlit King, who is head of the Winter Court.

## Shadow Sorceress

The Queen of Night and Magic does not bear her moniker lightly. She is a devastatingly potent sorceress, augmented with command over the stuff of shadows. Though her nature is undeniably dark, Queen Sarastra is hardly unreasonable. She is quick to recognize the value in any supplicant, mortal or fey, who catches her royal eye. She is never one to ignore an opportunity to further her agenda or to gain further power over the Moonlit King.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Queen of Night and Magic's Lair

The Queen of Night and Magic makes her home in the Plane of Shadows in the ancient halls of the courts of the shadow fey. Her lair is a great castle of delicate spires and graceful bridges with sprawling wings that house various members of the court.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Queen of Night and Magic makes three Rapier or Star Strike attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting or Unravel.

***Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) cold damage.

***Star Strike.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+15` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) fire damage plus 9 (`2d8`) radiant damage.

***Unravel.*** The Queen of Night and Magic ends one magical effect she can see within 60 feet of her. To do so, she must succeed on a Charisma check against a DC of 10 + the spell's level or the magical effect's DC, whichever is higher.

***Shadow Rift (Recharge 5-6).*** The Queen of Night and Magic creates a shadowy rift on a point she can see within 120 feet. Each creature within the 20 feet of the rift must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (`8d8`) cold damage and 36 (`8d8`) necrotic damage and is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by wisps of icy shadow for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Bonus Actions

***Hidden Step.*** The Queen of Night and Magic magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see and takes the Hide action.

## Reactions

***Sudden Fraying.*** When the Queen of Night and Magic is targeted by a spell or included in a spell's area and the spell doesn't have an instantaneous duration, she can use Unravel on the spell, dispelling it after it is cast. She doesn't need to see a spell to target it with this reaction, but she must be able to see at least some portion of an area or object affected by the spell.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** The Queen of Night and Magic makes one Star Strike attack. She doesn't have disadvantage on this attack roll from being within 5 feet of a creature, though she can have disadvantage from other sources.
