| 1 | **Nation.** I am devoted to the restoration of Benalia's empire. |
| 2 | **Peace.** Life can truly thrive only when war and strife are stilled. |
| 3 | **Protection.** I will also protect the less fortunate from the depredations of the rich and strong. |
| 4 | **Hope.** The world is emerging from a long despair, and needs every shred of inspiration we can offer. |
| 5 | **Honor.** If I dishonor myself, I bring dishonor on my deity, my nation, and my family. |
| 6 | **Solidarity.** Together, we are stronger than any of us alone. |
