# Mngwa
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 273*  

*Tiny wisps of grayish smoke ooze from the slate-colored coat of this leonine creature.*

## Ethereal Lions

The elusive mngwa (MING-wah) are the offspring of a sentient feline beast from the Ethereal Plane that mated with a lioness long ago. Also called*nunda*("smoke-cats"), mngwas are strong, cunning hunters who can elude pursuit or approach their prey unnoticed by disappearing briefly into the ether.

## Rocky Terrain

Mngwas choose their hunting ground carefully, avoiding flatlands where competing predators are plentiful. They favor rocky and treacherous terrain where their talent for dancing along the veil between worlds allows them to outmaneuver their prey.

## Feline Allies

The strongest mngwa recruit other great cats into their prides, though these associations tend to be short-lived. They hunt with especially savage groups of nkosi, though only a great pridelord can command one during a hunt. When the hunt is over, the mngwa move on, and sometimes they take one of the young nkosi with them to become a shaman.
