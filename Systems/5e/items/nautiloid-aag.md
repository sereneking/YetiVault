# Nautiloid
*Spelljammer, Vehicle (space)*  

- **Cost**: 50,000 gp

Built and used by mind flayers, nautiloids are designed exclusively for space travel. They can't float on water, nor can they land safely on the ground.

As an action, a creature attuned to a nautiloid's spelljamming helm and in physical contact with the ship can transport the nautiloid and all creatures and objects aboard it to a different plane of existence, at or near a destination envisioned by the spelljammer (or to a random location on the plane if no destination is envisioned). This property is a feature of the ship, not the spelljamming helm. Each time this property is used, roll a `d6`. On a 5â€“6, the property recharges after 1 minute; otherwise, it can't be used again for 24 hours.
