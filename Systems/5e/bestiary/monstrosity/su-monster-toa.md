# Su-monster
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 232*  

Su-monsters are cunning, wicked primates that inhabit forsaken wilderness areas and caves. Adults stand 5 feet tall and have long prehensile tails. Although they can grasp tools and weapons with their tails or clawed feet, su-monsters prefer to rend prey with their claws. Adult su-monsters can also project blasts of psionic energy that leave enemies [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) and unable to flee or defend themselves.

A su-monster sleeps while hanging upside down by its tail. While awake, it can also unleash a devastating attack from that position, rending with all four of its claws.

Su-monsters communicate silently by using their prehensile tails to make gestures. They typically kill more than they can eat, burying the leftovers and marking their location with the victim's possessions.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) slashing damage, or 12 (`4d4 + 2`) slashing damage if the su-monster is hanging by its tail and all four of its limbs are free.

***Psychic Crush (Recharge 5-6).*** The su-monster targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 17 (`5d6`) psychic damage and be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
