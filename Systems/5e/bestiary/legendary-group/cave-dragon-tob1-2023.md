# Cave Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Cave-In.** The ceiling collapses above one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (`3d6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and buried. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone or buried. A buried creature is restrained and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take an action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.  
- **Release the Vermin.** A 20-foot radius sphere of insects appears centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. When a creature enters the cloud of insects for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The cloud of insects lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Split the Earth.** A crack appears in the ground within 120 feet of the dragon that is 10 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 20 feet deep. Each creature standing on a spot where the crack opens must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall in, taking falling damage. A creature that successfully saves moves with the crack's edge as it opens. The crack remains open for 1 minute, until the dragon uses this lair action again, or until the dragon dies  

## Regional effects


The region containing a legendary cave dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Flight of the Beetles.** Swarms of vermin within 1 mile of the lair increase in both size and number as their populations try to survive the dragon's undiscriminating hunger.  
- **Toxic Air.** Once each hour, poisonous and odorless gases fill random passages and caverns for 1 minute, and just as quickly disperse, within 6 miles of the dragon's lair.  
- **Water Underground.** Each time the dragon's temper flares, but no more often than once every 30 days, flash flooding turns tunnels into death traps as tremors create fissures in the stone within 6 miles of the lair. On the surface, ponds drain away, and long-dry creek beds break their banks in flood.  

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
