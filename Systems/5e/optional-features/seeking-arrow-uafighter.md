# Seeking Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter p. 2*  

Using divination magic, you grant your arrow the ability to seek out your target, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. As an action, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute, and make a ranged attack against it, using the Arcane Arrow. The arrow flies around corners if necessary, and this attack ignores three-quarters cover, half cover, and disadvantage caused by the target being out of sight or being at long range. The attack automatically misses if the target is out of the weapon's range or if there is no path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target. If the arrow hits its target, you know it, but you don't learn the target's location unless it's within your line of sight.
