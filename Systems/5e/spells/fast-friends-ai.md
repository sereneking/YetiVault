# Fast Friends
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

When you need to make sure something gets done, you can't rely on vague promises, sworn oaths, or binding contracts of employment. When you cast this spell, choose one humanoid within range that can see and hear you, and that can understand you. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you for the duration. While the creature is [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, it undertakes to perform any services or activities you ask of it in a friendly manner, to the best of its ability.

You can set the creature new tasks when a previous task is completed, or if you decide to end its current task. If the service or activity might cause harm to the creature, or if it conflicts with the creature's normal activities and desires, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw to try to end the effect. This save is made with advantage if you or your companions are fighting the creature. If the activity would result in certain death for the creature, the spell ends.

When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Bard](/Systems/5e/classes/bard.md), [Cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
