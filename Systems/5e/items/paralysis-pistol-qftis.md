# Paralysis Pistol
*Adventuring Gear*  


This curious-looking pistol is shaped like a large, glass bulb with a handle on the bottom and brass prongs protruding from its front. The weapon is powered by an [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) stored in its grip. Placing a full [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) in the pistol gives the pistol 6 charges.

As an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a ray of crackling energy at a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target's turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Replacing the Energy Cell

While the pistol has charges remaining, its [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) can't be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
