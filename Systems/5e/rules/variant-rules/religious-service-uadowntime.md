# Religious Service
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 11* 

Characters with a religious bent might wish to spend their downtime in service to a temple. This activity has the chance of winning the favor of the temple's leaders.

## Resources

Religious service requires one workweek of time and no gold piece cost.

## Resolution

The character chooses to make either an Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) or a Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check. The result of the check determines the benefits of service, as shown on the Religious Service table.

**Religious Service**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–10 | No effect. You leave no lasting impression. |
| 11–20 | You earn one favor. |
| 21+ | You earn two favors. |

A favor is a promise for future assistance. It can be expended to ask the temple for help in dealing with a problem, for political or social support, or to reduce the cost of cleric spellcasting by 50 percent.

At one time, a character can have a number of unexpended favors no higher than 1 + their Charisma modifier (minimum of one favor).

## Complications

Temples can be labyrinths of political and social scheming. Even the best-intentioned sect can fall prone to rivalries. Serving a temple risks a character's becoming embroiled in such struggles.
