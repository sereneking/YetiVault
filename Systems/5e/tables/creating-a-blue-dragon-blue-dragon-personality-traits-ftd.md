**Blue Dragon Personality Traits**

`dice: [](creating-a-blue-dragon-blue-dragon-personality-traits-ftd.md#^blue-dragon-personality-traits)`

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I enforce order and social hierarchies because I believe this is how strong societies are built. |
| 2 | Why waste time and energy murdering weaker creatures when I can make them entertain me instead? |
| 3 | My children, whether born to me or chosen by me, are treasures. |
| 4 | Nothing is funnier than tricking a thirsty traveler into drinking a mouthful of sand. |
| 5 | I have standards for my hoard. Not just any gem or trinket will do. |
| 6 | I'm so pleased with myself and my own good fortune that I can't stop laughing or chuckling. |
| 7 | I would rather destroy my lair and lose my hoard than allow anyone to steal from me. |
| 8 | I am sometimes secretly impressed by what other peoples can accomplish with the proper guidance. |
