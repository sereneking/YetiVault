# Queen of Witches
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 180*  

*This statuesque woman towers over any tall man and most ogres. Her hair falls in a cascade of curls and looks as if it is spun from copper. Her eyes are the color of moss beds, with no iris or pupil. A billowy robe of forest green enshrouds her body, and she grasps a great ring of etched silver in one massive fist*.

Nicnevin, the Queen of Witches, is the Mountain Ogress, Lady of Copper and Crystal, and the Moon Weaver. She is not what one usually imagines in a fey lady, but she has an imposing figure of mass and power. Her stature speaks to great physical strength and the stalwart defiance of the mountain itself, but her true power is in her command of magic.

## Pact Patron

The Queen of Witches is one of the foremost patrons of those who seek power through a pact. Many hag covens offer her loyalty and tribute. She rules from beneath her mountain, attended by a court of fey witches, hags, and mortal supplicants. Her favor is highly sought after, and it is said that a single hair from her coppery head contains all the power a mortal might ever desire.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Queen of Witches's Lair

The Queen of Witches makes her lair in a cavern deep beneath a windswept, rocky mountain. Near the mountain's peak is an enormous quartz crystal that grows down to the lair. This crystal channels the light of the moon into the Queen's home when she doesn't emerge into the night sky. Her hags and attendant witches perform powerful rites in this magic-saturated sanctum.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The Queen of Witches has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Moonlit Weapons.*** The Queen of Witches's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 7 (`2d6`) radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Queen of Witches fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Token of Favor.*** The Queen of Witches can spend 1 minute cutting and tying a lock of her hair into a small token of her favor. A creature that is wearing or carrying the favor gains the benefits of the Magic Resistance trait. The Queen can revoke this magic at any time (no action required). If she does so, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects for 24 hours.

***Spellcasting.*** The Queen of Witches casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (save DC 20):

**At will**: [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md), [silent image](/Systems/5e/spells/silent-image.md), [tongues](/Systems/5e/spells/tongues.md)

**1/day each**: [power word kill](/Systems/5e/spells/power-word-kill.md), [sleep](/Systems/5e/spells/sleep.md) (as a 9th level spell), [true polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/true-polymorph.md)

**2/day each**: [bestow curse](/Systems/5e/spells/bestow-curse.md), [mass suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/mass-suggestion.md), [flesh to stone](/Systems/5e/spells/flesh-to-stone.md)

**3/day each**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [hypnotic pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md), [teleportation circle](/Systems/5e/spells/teleportation-circle.md) (as an action)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Queen of Witches makes three Moonsilver Ring attacks or four Mystical Blast attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of spellcasting. If she hits one creature with two Mystical Blast attacks, the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from her.

***Moonsilver Ring.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) slashing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) radiant damage.

***Mystical Blast.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`3d6 + 6`) force damage.

***Spray of Moonlight (Recharge 5-6).*** The Queen of Witches sends moonlight flooding out from her. Each creature within 15 feet of her must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (`12d6`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the Queen is standing in an area of moonlight when she uses this action, each creature in the area has disadvantage on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of its next turn.

## Reactions

***Absorb Spell.*** When a creature the Queen of Witches can see within 30 feet of her casts a spell, the Queen can absorb the spell's energy, countering it. This works like the [counterspell](/Systems/5e/spells/counterspell.md) spell, except the Queen must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell's level. Her ability check for this is +10. If she successfully counters the spell, she regains 5 hp for each level of the spell.

## Legendary Actions

***Mystical Blast.*** The Queen makes one Mystical Blast attack.

***Teleport.*** The Queen magically teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space she can see within 60 feet.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Queen of Witches uses Spellcasting.
