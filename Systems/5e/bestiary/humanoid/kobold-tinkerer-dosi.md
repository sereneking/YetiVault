# Kobold Tinkerer
*Source: Dragons of Stormwreck Isle p. 43*  

Kobolds are reptilian Humanoids that often revere dragons. Physically weak, they find strength in numbers.

A few kobolds are born with leathery wings and can fly, which is often seen as a gift from dragon gods.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Alchemical Flame (Recharge 6).*** The kobold unleashes fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
