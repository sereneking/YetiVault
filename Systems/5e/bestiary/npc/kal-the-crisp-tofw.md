## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Kal makes two Havoc Hammer or Havoc Flask attacks.

***Havoc Hammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`2d8`) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

***Havoc Flask.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d12`) fire damage. If the target is a creature, magical flames cling to it, causing it to take 3 (`1d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. Immediately after taking this damage on its turn, the target can make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a successful save.

After Kal throws the flask, roll a `d6`; on a 3 or lower, Kal has no more flasks to throw.
