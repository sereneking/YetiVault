# Havel of the Autumn Moon
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Havel is a frail but courageous huden gallus, with pheasant-like plumage. He is a dear friend of Tevor, and the two have fallen for each other during their time together in Alderheart. Havel is a Summerblossom, a rank given to experienced members of the Tenders. He has been working at the Tenders' headquarters in the Trunk district, where he provides aid to the refugees. He is also skilled in the use of natural magic, and while normally too sickly to adventure, could still assist the party with his talents.

## Traits

***Glide.*** When falling at least 10 feet, Havel can spend a reaction to fly up to his speed in one direction as he descends. He lands in an unoccupied space at the end of his movement, and takes no falling damage. Havel cannot glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though he can drop any held items as part of their reaction).

***Wing Flap.*** As a bonus action, Havel can use his powerful feathered arms to propel himself upward up to half his movement speed. He can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding.

***Seedspeech.*** Havel can communicate simple ideas to living plants, and is able to interpret their responses in simple language.

***Spellcasting.*** Havel is a 4th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). He has the following spells prepared:
