# Simic Keyrune
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a member of the Simic guild)*  


This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of-pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a [category 1 krasis](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/category-1-krasis-ggr.md) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.

When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a [category 1 krasis](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/category-1-krasis-ggr.md) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform.

The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the [Dodge](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and moves to avoid danger.

At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.
