# Piercing Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter p. 2*  

You use transmutation magic to transform your arrow into an ethereal dart that passes through its targets. When you attack with this arrow, it fires forward in a line that is 1 foot wide and 30 feet long. You make a separate attack using your Arcane Arrow against each creature in that line.
