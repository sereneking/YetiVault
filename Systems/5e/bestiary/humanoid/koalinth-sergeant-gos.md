# Koalinth Sergeant
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 239*  

These fierce koalinths lead special missions for their people, such as the diplomatic envoy encountered in Danger at Dunwater. A koalinth sergeant focuses its ire on the most significant threats on the battlefield, then eliminates those threats one by one.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The koalinth can breathe air and water.

***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the sergeant can deal an extra 7 (`2d6`) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 feet of an ally of the sergeant that isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sergeant makes two melee attacks with its trident.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage, or 6 (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Hooked Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 10/30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a hooked net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.

## Reactions

***Spear the Helpless (2/Day).*** Whenever a creature within 30 feet of the sergeant becomes [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), the sergeant can move its speed toward the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature. If the sergeant ends its move within reach of the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature, it can make a melee attack against it.
