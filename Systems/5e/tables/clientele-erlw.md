**Clientele**

`dice: [](clientele-erlw.md#^clientele)`

| dice: d6 | Clientele |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | **Wealthy Socialites**. Your discretion and low-key approach to cases make you the perfect team to handle cases best keep out of the public eye. |
| 2 | **Underdogs**. Whether deserved or not, you have a reputation for doing the right thing even if it comes without a reasonable fee. Anyone pitted against the rich and powerful knows to come to you for justice. |
| 3 | **Magnet for Trouble**. Maybe you trust people too easily or it's just bad luck, but every client who walks into your office has some double deal, hidden agenda, or scam they're running. |
| 4 | **Desperate**. You have a reputation for taking on clients who can't afford your services. Every hard-luck case ends up at your door, whether you want them or not. |
| 5 | **Warforged**. In a world where the rights of warforged are not always certain, you take up their cause. |
| 6 | **Criminals**. When a criminal has been wronged but doesn't want to be brought to justice they come to you, trusting (rightly or wrongly) that you won't turn them in. |
