# Stein (Stone Rune)
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Ranger, and Rogue p. 2*  

This rune's magic channels the insightfulness of a stone giant. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks, and you have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision), its range increases by 30 feet.

In addition, when a creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to invoke the rune and force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the creature is [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the creature has a speed of 0 and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), descending into a dreamy stupor. The effect ends if the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its haze. Once you invoke the rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
