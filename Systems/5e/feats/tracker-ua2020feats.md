You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for this spell.  
- You have advantage on Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to track creatures
