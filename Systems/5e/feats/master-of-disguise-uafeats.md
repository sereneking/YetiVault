# Master of Disguise
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 4*  

You have honed your ability to shape your personality and to read the personalities of others. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency with the [disguise kit](/Systems/5e/items/disguise-kit.md). If you are already proficient with it, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- If you spend 1 hour observing a creature, you can then spend 8 hours crafting a disguise you can quickly don to mimic that creature. Making the disguise requires a [disguise kit](/Systems/5e/items/disguise-kit.md). You must make checks as normal to disguise yourself, but you can assume the disguise as an action.
