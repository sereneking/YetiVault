## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Yorb can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples Yorb or otherwise comes into direct contact with Yorb's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature no longer in direct contact with Yorb can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** Yorb's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

## Actions

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`2d4`) poison damage.

***Mesmerizing Chirr (Recharge 6).*** Yorb makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each humanoid or beast that is within 15 feet of Yorb and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of Yorb's next turn.
