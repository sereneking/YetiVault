Where thunder cracks and conflict rises, prayers to the Stormlord are shouted into the maelstrom. Reveling in all tests of strength, the blessing of the Stormlord finds those that prove themselves on the battlefield. Worshiped by athletes and warriors all across Exandria, he exalts those whose force of spirit and passion for victory call his attention. He brings tumultuous storms over land and sea, and those who wish for clearer skies offer their praises and prayers to appease him.

## Depiction

Within his temples and carvings, the Stormlord is shown as a quintessential warrior, often nude with a beard and short, curly hair. As the epitome of muscle and strength, most art depicts the Stormlord in a stance of dominance, typically asserting his power by wrestling a terrible beast.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Stormlord's clerics are granted powers of Tempest or War.

## Holy Day

The Stormlord's holy day is the Day of Challenging, and it is celebrated on the seventh day of the second month. The Day of Challenging is one of the most raucous holidays in "Emon", and thousands of spectators attend the annual "Godsbrawl" held in the Temple of the Stormlord to root for their favored deity's champion, particularly the chosen of the Stormlord and the Platinum Dragon.

- Bravery above all. There is no glory in cowardice.  
- Strength is the path to greatness, but greatness is the responsible use of strength.  
- The glory of the Stormlord lives through your own glory on the battlefield.
