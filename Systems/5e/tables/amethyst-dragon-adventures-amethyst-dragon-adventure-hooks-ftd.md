| 2 | A coven of hags seeks to reclaim its hag eye, which rests within an amethyst dragon's hoard. |

| 6 | An [amethyst dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/amethyst-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) is actually the temporally displaced form of an [ancient amethyst dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-amethyst-dragon-ftd.md) who already exists in the same time line. |
| 7 | An amethyst dragon seeks the means to plant special crystals that will allow the dragon to magically coexist in multiple places at once across the world during a rare celestial alignment. |
