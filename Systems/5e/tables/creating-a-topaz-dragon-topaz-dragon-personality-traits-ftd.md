| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I seek no company other than my own, for no one else can compete with me. |
| 2 | If my offspring can't care for themselves, I'm not sure they're worthy of my attention. |
| 3 | The sea is beautiful and I love gazing upon it, but I abhor being wet. |
| 4 | Why should I risk damaging my splendid physique when I can fight with the power of my mind? |
| 5 | I am predictable only in my unpredictability. |
| 6 | It takes true artistry to maintain a warm, desert-like dwelling under the water. |
| 7 | I soothe myself to sleep by imagining the perfect insults for bronze dragons; while I wait to meet one, I hone them on other creatures. |
| 8 | I secretly enjoy conversing with lesser beings, although I usually do so only to find their weaknesses. |
