# Clockwork Observer
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 85*  

A clockwork observer serves as an aerial spy for its creator. It looks like a mechanical, grapefruit-sized orb suspended under softly humming propeller blades. Embedded in the orb are keenly perceptive crystal eyes that enable the observer to see in multiple directions at once. When it perceives something troubling, the observer sounds the alarm by emitting a shriek that can be heard within a range of 300 feet. The observer can also telepathically relay what it has discovered to its creator, provided the two are within 1 mile of each other.

## Traits

***Flyby.*** The observer doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Telepathic Bond.*** While the observer is within 1 mile of its creator, it can magically convey what it sees to its creator, and the two can communicate telepathically.

***Unusual Nature.*** The observer doesn't need air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Shriek.*** The observer emits a mechanical shriek until the start of its next turn or until it drops to 0 hit points. This shriek can be heard within a range of 300 feet.
