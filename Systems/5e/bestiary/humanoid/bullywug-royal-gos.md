# Bullywug Royal
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 232, The Wild Beyond the Witchlight*  

The largest and most intelligent bullywugs invariably end up leading their kind. These sneering specimens dress in robes made from leather, rough cloth, and bits of marsh plants. As seen in Danger at Dunwater, a bullywug royal is often accompanied by and mounted astride a giant toad.
