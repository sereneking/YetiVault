# Shyla Denn
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

A scarred, gray-and-russet-furred vulpin cleric of Kren, Shyla serves as Krall's lieutenant. Krall saved her life when she was a child, orphaned in the Wood, and she has been grateful to him ever since. Her loyalty to Krall is absolute, and she believes that Krall will only cut loose those who can't pull their weight. Shyla uses the [vulpin priest of kren](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/vulpin-priest-of-kren-hwcs.md) stat block.
