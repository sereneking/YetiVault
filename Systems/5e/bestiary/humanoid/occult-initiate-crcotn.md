# Occult Initiate
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 205*  

Occult initiates are the most recent inductees into their organization and the members of the organization most often encountered by outsiders.

## Occultists of the Vermilion Dream

The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.

The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.

## Actions

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) psychic damage.

***Arcane Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The initiate creates an explosion of magical force in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point it can see within 120 feet of itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 10 (`3d6`) force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the center of the area. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.
