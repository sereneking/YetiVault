# Naturalist
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 3*  

Your extensive study of nature rewards you with the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You learn the [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md) and [detect poison and disease](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md) spells. You can cast [detect poison and disease](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-poison-and-disease.md) once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
