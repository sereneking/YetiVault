**Karametra's Divine Schemes**

| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Karametra's statues have covered their faces as if in despair, and nothing will grow. No one seems to know what has caused the god of fertility to withdraw her blessings from the world, but the problem must be solved if life is to endure. |
| 2 | Karametra judges that mortals have over produced and moves to cull populations. She creates new plant species that feed on mortals, while her followers act oddly, running off to join bloody revels or sacrificing each other in the fields. How many must die before balance is restored? |
| 3 | Karametra's civilizing influence infringes on the territory and freedom of other nature gods, and so Nylea and Pharika band together to reduce her power. |
| 4 | Karametra bestows her gifts on a wild cultist or minotaur champion trying to encourage her older, more bloodthirsty worship. The faith takes hold, causing the god to make vicious demands of her followers. |
