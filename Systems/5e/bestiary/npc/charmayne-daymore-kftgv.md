# Charmayne Daymore
*Source: Keys from the Golden Vault p. 159*  

A powerful spellcaster, Charmayne had become jealous of the king's passion and warmth. Longing to possess those qualities, she painstakingly created rituals to drain Jhaeros's vitality and charm, and to funnel these qualities into herself. However, the magic only enhanced her greed and jealousy; the more she took from Jhaeros, the hungrier for power Charmayne became, going so far as to murder her fellow councilor, Regine, while she slept.

As she came to realize the people of Ghalasine didn't love her as they did the king, Charmayne became filled with rage. She used magic to tear out Jhaeros's heart while keeping it alive. She then used the still-beating heart as the focus of a ritual to destroy Ghalasine.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Charmayne fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** Charmayne casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1/day each**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md), [polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/polymorph.md)

**3/day**: [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Charmayne makes three Ashen Burst attacks. She can replace one of these attacks with one use of Spellcasting.

***Ashen Burst.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`5d6`) fire damage.

***Cinder Spite (Recharge 5-6).*** Charmayne creates a magical explosion of fire centered on a point she can see within 120 feet of herself. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this damage dies and is transformed into a Tiny charcoal figurine.

## Reactions

***Charmayne can take up to three reactions per round but only one per turn..*** 

***Elemental Rebuke.*** In response to being hit by an attack, Charmayne utters a word in Ignan, dealing 10 (`3d6`) fire damage to the attacker. Charmayne then teleports, along with any equipment she is wearing or carrying, up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving a harmless cloud of ash and embers in the space she just left.

***Fiery Counterspell.*** Charmayne interrupts a creature she can see within 60 feet of herself that is casting a spell. If the spell is 4th level or lower, it fails and has no effect. If the spell is 5th level or higher, Charmayne makes an Intelligence check (DC 10 + the spell's level). On a success, the spell fails and has no effect. Whatever the spell's level, the caster takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage if the spell fails.
