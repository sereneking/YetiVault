**Suggested Ideals**

`dice: [](fighter-or-ranger-suggested-ideals-psd.md#^suggested-ideals)`

| dice: d8 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Riashil Pacifism.** To live at peace with nature, we must first learn to live at peace with each other. |
| 2 | **Staprion Defiance.** Those who cross lines must be put in their place. |
| 3 | **Loridalh Interdependence.** I am my own master, but I am strongest when I work as part of the web of all life. |
| 4 | **Kelfae Flexibility.** The search for stability—whether in a swaying treetop or in the turmoil of life—is fruitless. |
| 5 | **Jubilar Remembrance.** The sacrifice of those who were exterminated in the Phyrexian Invasion must be remembered, and their stories retold. |
| 6 | **Basiphem Pride.** Because we are strong, it is our responsibility to aid the rest of the forest where we can. |
| 7 | **Hedressel Holiness.** We must maintain our distance—culturally and physically—from other peoples to maintain our connections to the wood. |
| 8 | **Ruadach Openness.** We must open ourselves to new cultures, new peoples, and new ideas, or we will rot like a fallen log. |
