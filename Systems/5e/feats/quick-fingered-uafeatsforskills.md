# Quick-Fingered
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 3*  

Your nimble fingers and agility let you perform sleight of hand. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- As a bonus action, you can make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to plant something on someone else, conceal an object on a creature, lift a purse, or take something from a pocket.
