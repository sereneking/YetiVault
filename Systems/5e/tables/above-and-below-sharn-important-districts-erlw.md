# Above and Below Sharn: Important Districts
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 164* 

| District | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Skyway | Skyway is a district that floats above Central Plateau and Menthis, built atop an island of solidified clouds. The richest people in Sharn live here. | Above the city |
| Cliffside | Boats bring cargo and passengers to the dock at Cliffside, on the edge of the Dagger River. From there, enormous lifts carry people up to Precarious. This dangerous district contains an assortment of taverns, shabby inns, and warehouses. | On the banks of the Dagger River |
| Ashblack | The first foundries of Sharn were built here. The district is devoted to industry, and the environment here is sweltering and claustrophobic. | The Cogs |
| Blackbones | Blackbones is newer than Ashblack, and it shows. The district's corridors are wider and better lit. The foundries are well maintained, and the district has a few thriving businesses. Most of the warforged that reside in Sharn work in Blackbones. | The Cogs |
