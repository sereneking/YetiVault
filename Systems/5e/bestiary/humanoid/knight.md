Knights are warriors who pledge service to rulers, religious orders, and noble causes. A knight's alignment determines the extent to which a pledge is honored. Whether undertaking a quest or patrolling a realm, a knight often travels with an entourage that includes squires and hirelings who are commoners.

## Traits

***Brave.*** The knight has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The knight makes two melee attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+2` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d10`) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
