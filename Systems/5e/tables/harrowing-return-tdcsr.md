| dice: d10 | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | **.** **Call of the Grave.** An angel of death is obsessed with your fleeting spirit, and wants you back. When you roll initiative at the start of combat, make a death saving throw. On a failed save, the GM chooses an undead creature with a CR equal to your level or lower. It appears at a point 120 feet away from you and joins the combat against you. The creature knows where you are at all times and pursues you unerringly. It vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points, when you die, or after 10 minutes. |
| 2 | **.** **Memories from the Beyond.** The memory of death lingers. At the end of each long rest, describe how your character has tried to forget what dying felt like, then make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC set by the GM based on your answer. On a failed save, you gain one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) that lasts until you are subject to [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) or similar magic, or until you spend 30 days in focused downtime to make peace with your memories. |
| 3 | **.** **Obscure Purpose.** A greater power allowed you to come back for a reason. This might be a god such as the Matron of Ravens that you can now commune with, or an obscure supernatural being. This consequence might be an opportunity to become a [cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md) or [paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md) of this god, or to take levels in the [warlock](/Systems/5e/classes/warlock.md) class. Alternatively, if you choose not to swear a covenant with this entity, or if you disobey their requests, roll again on this table. You suffer the new consequences until you adhere to the purpose of this entity or find a way to rid yourself of their attention. |
| 4 | **.** **Persistent Wounds.** Whenever you fail a death saving throw, your hit point maximum is reduced by `2d10` until you finish a long rest. If your hit point maximum is reduced to 0 in this way, you die. |
| 5 | **.** **Secret Face.** You are no longer you, but a chaotic evil shapechanger who has taken your place. You play this duplicate and use your original game statistics until the duplicate is killed or until this consequence is otherwise overcome. The GM determines where your soul is actually being held captiveâ€”possibly in the afterlife for which you were intended, or in your double's malign realm. |
| 6 | **.** **Hunger for Death.** Once per day, you or the GM must decide that you use the following reaction: When you see a creature you perceive as hostile or potentially hostile and your distance to that creature is equal to or less than your speed, you immediately and aggressively move your speed toward that creature, then make one melee attack against it. You have advantage on the attack roll if your attack is unexpected. |
| 7 | **.** **Opaque Thoughts.** You obsessively recall the sensation of life tearing you from the jaws of death. These ever-present memories fill your mind, making you immune to any effect that would sense your emotions or read your thoughts. Likewise, other creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks made to ascertain your intentions. |
| 8 | **.** **Unearthly Awareness.** Your ordeal left a mark upon your soul, which now shudders in the presence of the undead. You know whenever an undead creature is within 30 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on attacks against [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) undead within this range. This constant awareness is distracting, however, and you have disadvantage on Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) and Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks while any undead creature is within 30 feet of you. |
| 9 | **.** **Bond of Vengance.** You have returned as a revenant, bearing an unquenchable spark of hatred for the creature that killed you. As an action, you can focus on this spark to immediately learn the distance and direction to any creature that has killed you. If that creature is on a different plane, you learn only that information. If a creature that killed you dies, you immediately know. If you are within 120 feet of a creature that killed you, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against any other creature. |
| 10 | **.** **Never Again.** You don't fall unconscious when reduced to 0 hit points. Instead, you remain conscious until you end your turn without having attacked a creature or cast a spell of 1st level or higher. While you have 0 hit points, you have advantage on attack rolls, your attacks deal an extra `1d10` damage on a hit, and attack rolls made against you have disadvantage. You make death saving throws as normal, including suffering a failure when you take damage. Additionally, whenever you take damage while at 0 hit points, your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage until you finish a long rest. |
