**Emerald Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-an-emerald-dragon-emerald-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^emerald-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Seclusion. It's safer if others don't know I'm hereâ€”safer for me and safer for them. (Any) |
| 2 | Observation. People lie. Histories lie. Even dragons lie. But actions always ring true. (Lawful) |
| 3 | Storytelling. There is a magic in the retelling of stories. Each new teller adds a bit of themself to the spell. (Any) |
| 4 | Nurture. Rearing a child is our best chance to make sure our own stories are passed on. (Any) |
| 5 | Inquisitiveness. Even the smallest village contains myriad stories of love, loss, triumph, and betrayal. There is always more to learn about people. (Any) |
| 6 | Espionage. Once I get paid for the information I glean, I don't care what others do with it. (Evil) |
