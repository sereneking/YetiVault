# Nkosi
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 286*  

*With a thick mane of beaded locks, this leonine humanoid grins with a mouthful of pointed teeth.*

## Beads and Braids

The nkosi resemble bestial humans with cat's eyes, slender tails, and the fangs and fur of a lion. Most grow their hair long, braiding colorful beads into their locks to mark important events in their lives. Although the nkosi's true form is that of a feline humanoid with leonine features, the most striking feature of the nkosi is their ability to change their shape, taking the form of a lion.

## Pridelords

Nkosi pridelords are exceptionally tall and muscular leaders. They keep impressive manes, but they are known for their roar, which wakes the feral heart inside all nkosi.

## Traits

***Keen Smell.*** The nkosi has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.

***Pounce.*** If the nkosi moves at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Mambele attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). If the target is [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), the nkosi can make one Bite attack against it as a bonus action.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Mambele (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** The nkosi transforms into a Large lion or back into its true form, which is Humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, speed, and AC, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
