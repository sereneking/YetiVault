# Ruidium Armor
*Generic Variant, very rare (requires attunement)*  


This magic armor has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While you wear this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to psychic damage.  
- You can breathe water.  
- You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.  

## Ruidium Corruption

When you roll a 1 on a saving throw while wearing this armor, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

## If Ruidium Is Destroyed

If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and ruidium armor becomes [+1 armor](/Systems/5e/items/1-armor.md).
