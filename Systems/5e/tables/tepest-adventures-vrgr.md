|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Toxic, vision-inducing fungi taint the ruined village of Briggdarrow. Recently, homesteaders outside Viktal discovered the fungus on their properties and claim it's being spread by strange fungus-covered bipeds (myconids). |
| 2 | A hermit who once lived in the abandoned fortress on Cas Island hires the party to retrieve an heirloom she left behind. But she warns that the Avanc, a dangerous lake monster, swims nearby. |
| 3 | A shepherd's youngest child went missing after a sinkhole opened in a nearby pasture, revealing a glowing cavern that leads into the tunnels of Arak. |
| 4 | The Parrish family fled Viktal in fear of Mother. They seek help revealing her malice to their former neighbors before she finds them. |
| 5 | Mother's Minders nail wicker dolls over the doors of a dozen houses in Viktal. Soon after, both the dolls and the inhabitants of those houses vanish. |
| 6 | A druid seeks aid in reclaiming their people's holy site from an ancient, evil [treant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/treant.md) called Blightroot. The druid doesn't mention that the surrounding forests are a clonal colony of the villainous plant. |
| 7 | A grieving villager begs the characters to take their deceased loved one to the Cauldron, a pool said to restore life to a corpse bathed in its waters. The villager says nothing of the terrible price the pool's magic exacts. |
| 8 | Two young lovers go missing from Viktal. One is found days later, unable to remember anything, aged fifty years, and desperate for help to find their partner. |
| 9 | A character's reflection on the water warns of impending doom. The image insists they find the Seer's Glass, which can reveal the past and future. |
| 10 | A strange old woman claims to have lost her child and begs the characters for help. Thus disguised, Lorinda hopes to have the party track down her runaway Laoirse. |
