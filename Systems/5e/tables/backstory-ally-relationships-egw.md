**Ally Relationships**

`dice: [](backstory-ally-relationships-egw.md#^ally-relationships)`

| dice: d100 | Relationship |
|------------|--------------|
| 01–10 | This ally is a loyal pet. Rather than rolling on the Ally and Rival Identities table, choose one beast of CR 1/8 or lower as your pet. |
| 11–20 | This person once lost a bet to you and is still trying to scrounge up the cash to pay you back. They've decided you'd both be better off if they put you in their debt instead. |
| 21–30 | This person was once a beggar to whom you gave a large sum of money. They have transformed their life thanks to you, and now want to repay your generosity. |
| 31–40 | You were this person's favorite drinking buddy, and their home is always open to you and your friends. |
| 41–50 | This person was once your mentor, but you left before you could complete your training. You are welcome to return and finish what you started, but only when you are ready. |
| 51–60 | You bonded with this person over a traumatic event such as a battle or an armed robbery. If you ever tell them that you are in danger, they will try to aid you. |
| 61–70 | You and this person share a terrible secret, and you have sworn to never reveal it to anyone. They will help you keep this secret if it is ever in danger of being revealed. |
| 71–80 | This person fell in love with you. If you reciprocated, they always stand at your side. If you didn't, they took it well, and still consider you their closest friend. |
| 81–90 | You and this person were affected by powerful magic, and now you both share a telepathic connection that functions while you are within 1 mile of each other. |
| 91–00 | This person owes you their life. Even if they can't follow you everywhere you go, they will do anything they can to protect you. |
