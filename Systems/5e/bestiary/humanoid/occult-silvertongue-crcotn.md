# Occult Silvertongue
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 205*  

Occult silvertongues are charismatic leaders. The alien mysteries to which they expose themselves can leave them feeling restless, paranoid, and suspicious. They begin to see things that aren't there and imagine conspiracies brought on by fears that others are trying to supplant them.

## Occultists of the Vermilion Dream

The Consortium of the Vermilion Dream is viewed as an esoteric, profit-driven, but ultimately harmless cabal of ghost hunters and perpetuators of urban legends. This perception isn't inaccurate, but the consortium's leadership is obsessed with one set of legends in particular: those involving the Moon of Ill Omen, Ruidus, and the ancient figures cursed by exposure to its alien influence.

The cruelest desires and predilections of the consortium's most obsessive agents have been enhanced by contact with ruidium-tainted items.

***Magic Resistance.*** The silvertongue has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The silvertongue casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**1/day**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md)

The earth elemental disappears after 1 minute or when it or the silvertongue dies.
