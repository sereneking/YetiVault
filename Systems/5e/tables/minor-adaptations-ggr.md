**Minor Adaptations**

`dice: [](minor-adaptations-ggr.md#^minor-adaptations)`

| dice: d8 | Minor Adaptations |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Amorphous Structure. The krasis can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. |
| 2 | Aquatic. The krasis gains a swimming speed equal to its walking speed. |
| 3 | Climbing Speed. The krasis gains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed. |
| 4 | Cryptic Skin. The krasis can change color to match its surroundings. It has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide. |
| 5 | Heightened Awareness. The krasis can't be [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised), as a result of having sensitive barbels like a catfish, stereoscopic vision like a chameleon, a tongue like a snake, eye stalks like a lobster, or an array of several eyes. |
| 6 | Ink Cloud (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). While underwater, the krasis can use a bonus action to expel a cloud of ink and then move up to its speed. The ink cloud is stationary and fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point in the krasis's space before it moves. The sphere is heavily obscured until the ink disperses after 1 minute. A strong current also disperses the ink cloud. |
| 7 | Leaping Legs. With or without a running start, the krasis's long jump is 20 feet (category 1), 30 feet (category 2), or 40 feet (category 3). Its high jump is 10 feet (category 1), 20 feet (category 2), or 30 feet (category 3). |
| 8 | Stabilizing Legs. The krasis has several crablike legs. As a result, it has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). |
