|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The characters find a bundle of *thought strands*, and Dimir agents are in a rush to find them before they fade away. |
| 2 | A rogue agent hunted by Dimir assassins offers crippling information about House Dimir in exchange for protection. |
| 3 | A Dimir horror (a [flying horror](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/flying-horror-ggr.md), [shadow horror](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/shadow-horror-ggr.md), or a [skittering horror](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/skittering-horror-ggr.md)) is randomly killing people in the dark alleys of a particular neighborhood. |
| 4 | Word is out that someone claims to have a list of Dimir agents embedded in other guilds, igniting a furious contest to obtain the list. |
| 5 | While prying too deeply into ancient lore, a Dimir agent (now deceased) released a nameless evil into the city. |
| 6 | Roll on another guild's adventure hooks table, but the Dimir are secretly behind the situation. |
