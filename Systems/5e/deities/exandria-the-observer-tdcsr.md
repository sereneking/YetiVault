Amidst the "Age of Arcanum", the people of the great "Tetrarchy of Qoniira" were visited by a being of sheltering power and comforting light. The people of Qoniira were on the path to creating the most prosperous civilization that the "Rifenmist Jungle"—and indeed, all of "Gwessar"—had ever seen. In its peace and magical might, it exceeded even the grasp of the nearby elven domain of "Syngorn". Magic, entirely separate from the arcane rituals practiced by arcanists of the era, fueled their city's rise to splendor, and the being that came to them looked on in fascination.

It appeared before them in a form that at once seemed familiar and majestic. It had a body like one of the "Catfolk"—a wiry humanoid frame with a feline face, covered in tawny fur and possessed of a tail and limbs that ended in large paws. Beyond this familiar appearance, four broad, avian wings burst from this ten-foot-tall avatar's back. It was surrounded by a golden light that seemed not to illuminate and saturate the world around it, but make it dimmer, ashy, and washed-out. Yet in this pallid light came a sharpness of perception, as if it were more real than the material world around it. The being appeared in the center of the Qoniira civilization, at the heart of the city of "Niirdal-Poc", and it spoke a single phrase: "I am the Observer, and I give unto you the Gift." Then, it vanished from sight.

All at once, the gray-gold light of the Observer surged throughout Qoniira. Though the citizens didn't notice a difference at first, as time went by, many people began to manifest new forms of magic. This magic was not the controlled, scientific power of far-off arcanists in their flying cities, but chaotic, unpredictable, and miraculous.

The once-sprawling civilization of Qoniira has shrunk over the centuries, but its people still draw upon the miracles of the Gift, and they are still watched from afar by the unseen Observer. This entity does not reign like a god, but watches impassively those whom it gave its unpredictable Gift. As those born in "Niirdal-Poc" under the auspices of the Observer travel north into the Republic of Tal'Dorei, or south into the oppressive realm of the "Iron Authority", the gaze of the Observer is moved even farther afield—adding ever more variables to its mysterious experiment.
