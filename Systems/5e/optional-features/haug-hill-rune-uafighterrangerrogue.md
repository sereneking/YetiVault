# Haug (Hill Rune)
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Ranger, and Rogue p. 1*  

This rune's magic bestows a resilience reminiscent of a hill giant. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on saving throws against being [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and you have resistance against poison damage.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action, gaining resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage for 1 minute. Once you invoke the rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
