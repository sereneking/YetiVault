# Squire of Solamnia
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn Revisited p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**:  Fighter,  Paladin, or [Knight of Solamnia](/Systems/5e/backgrounds/knight-of-solamnia-ua2022heroesofkrynnrevisited.md)

Your training in the ways of the Knights of Solamnia grants you these benefits:

- **Mount Up.** Mounting or dismounting costs you only 5 feet of movement.  
- **Squire Maneuvers.** You learn the [Lunging Attack](/Systems/5e/optional-features/lunging-attack.md), [Precision Attack](/Systems/5e/optional-features/precision-attack.md), or [Pushing Attack](/Systems/5e/optional-features/pushing-attack.md) maneuver from the Battle Master subclass of the fighter in the Player's Handbook (choose the maneuver when you gain this feat). If the maneuver requires a saving throw, the save's DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace the maneuver you learned from this feat with another one from the list above.  
- **Superiority Dice.** You gain a number of superiority dice equal to your proficiency bonus. These dice are d6s, and you can use them only with the maneuver you gain from this feat and with any maneuvers you gain from feats that have this feat as a prerequisite. A superiority die is expended when you use it, and you regain all expended superiority dice when you finish a long rest.
