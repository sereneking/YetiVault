- **Ability Scores**: Dexterity +2
- **Size**: Small
- **Speed**: 25 ft.

## Traits

### Age

Goblins mature faster than humans, reaching adulthood at around age 12. They also age noticeably faster than humans, and even the most cautious goblins rarely live longer than 50 years.

### Alignment

Most goblins are wildly chaotic, with no particular inclination toward good or evil but a strong tendency toward mischief.

### Size

Goblins average about 3 feet tall and weigh about 40 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Darkvision

Thanks to your heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common Trade Pidgin (if it exists in your campaign) and Goblin.

### Agile Climber

You have a climbing speed of 25 feet. You can't use your climbing speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for [encumbrance](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/encumbrance.md), you can't use your climbing speed if you are encumbered.)

## Description

Goblins are native to Ixalan, and their eager curiosity drew them to the ships of the Brazen Coalition when the pirates first made landfall on the Sun Empire's shores. Though they still thrive in remote jungle colonies, goblins are most commonly seen swinging on the ropes of sleek pirate ships.

Goblins stand about three feet tall, though they rarely stand upright. They prefer a crouched posture that lets them scramble quickly on all fours, aided by their long prehensile tails. Their hearing and eyesight make them excellent lookouts, and their agility serves them well as crew members on pirate ships. They climb, swing, and jump easily among a ship's ropes, and can get into tight spaces that humans can't. For better or worse, many goblins are also incorrigible pranksters, and they often have a hard time determining when a prank is inappropriate, is poorly timed, or has gone too far.
