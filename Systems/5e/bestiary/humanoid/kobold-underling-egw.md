# Kobold Underling
*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 221*  

Kobolds are craven reptilian humanoids that commonly infest dungeons. They make up for their physical ineptitude with a cleverness for trap making.

## Traits

***Messy End.*** The kobold explodes 3 rounds after it dies, or immediately if it was killed by a critical hit. The explosion destroys the kobold's body, leaving its equipment behind. Each creature within 5 feet of the exploding kobold must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (`1d8`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Pack Tactics.*** The kobold has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kobold's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kobold has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.
