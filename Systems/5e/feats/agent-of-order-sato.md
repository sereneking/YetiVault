# Agent of Order
*Source: Sigil and the Outlands p. 10*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You can channel cosmic forces of order to gain these benefits:

- **Stasis Strike.** Once per turn, when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can deal an extra `1d8` force damage to the target, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the spellcasting ability you chose for the Scion of the Outer Planes feat) as spectral bindings try to ensnare it. On a successful save, the target escapes. On a failed save, the target has the restrained condition until the start of your next turn. These bindings manifest as chains or some other symbol of stasis. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
