*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 3*  

Your presence in a scrap tends to elevate your comrades. You gain the following benefits:

- You can use the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action as a bonus action.  
- When you use the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action to aid an ally in attacking a creature, increase the range of the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action by 10 feet. Additionally, you can help two allies targeting the same creature within range when you use the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action this way.
