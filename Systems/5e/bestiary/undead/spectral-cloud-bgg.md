# Spectral Cloud
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 176*  

A cloud giant that dies through an act of betrayal or an ill-fated wager sometimes returns as a spectral cloud. While this Undead seems to be merely a thick cloud or fog bank, observers can sometimes spot a shadowy bipedal figure lurking within. At the heart of the cloud, the figure's appearance becomes clear: a skeletal cloud giant corpse.

Tales suggest cloud giants sometimes seek this fate rather than accept the end of their naturally long lives. In such stories, a cloud giant undergoes a ritual in which its heart is transplanted into a cloud, causing the giant's body to dissolve and its spirit to animate the cloud.

## Traits

***Blurred Form.*** Attack rolls against the spectral cloud are made with disadvantage unless the attacker is within 15 feet of the spectral cloud or the spectral cloud is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The spectral cloud can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spectral cloud makes two Spectral Touch attacks.

***Spectral Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d8 + 7`) force damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.

A Humanoid slain by this attack immediately rises as a miniature spectral cloud (use the [specter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) stat block in the Monster Manual). The miniature spectral cloud acts as an ally of its creator but isn't under its control.

***Chilling Winds (Recharge 5-6).*** The spectral cloud emits intensely cold wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 38 (`7d10`) cold damage and has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition for 1 minute. The affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, that creature is immune to this spectral cloud's Chilling Winds for the next 24 hours.
