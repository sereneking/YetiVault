# Rune Carver Adept
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 8*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

Your ability to draw out power from runes has grown.

Increase the ability score of the spellcasting ability chosen when you gained the Rune Carver Apprentice feat by 1, to a maximum of 20.

Whenever you cast a spell from the Rune Spells table, or a spell of a school of magic associated with the spell you marked on an object from your Rune Carver Apprentice feat, you can invoke runic power, granting you one of these benefits of your choice:

- **Battle Runes.** Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Until the end of that creature's next turn, it has advantage on the next attack roll it makes.  
- **Healing Runes.** Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to your level.  
- **Runic Winds.** Choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. Until the end of that creature's turn, its movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and its walking speed increases by 10 feet.  

You can invoke runic power a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, but no more than once per spell you cast. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
