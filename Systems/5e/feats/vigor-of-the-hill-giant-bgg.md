# Vigor of the Hill Giant
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 19*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the resilience emblematic of hill giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Bulwark.** When you are subjected to an effect that would move you at least 5 feet or give you the prone condition, you can use your reaction to steady yourself. You aren't moved and don't have the prone condition.  
- **Iron Stomach.** Whenever you eat food as part of a short rest and spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.
