# Froghemoth Elder

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the froghemoth can take one of the following lair actions; the froghemoth can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Croak.** The froghemoth lets out an ear-splitting croak. Each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the deafened and frightened conditions until the end of its next turn.  
- **Hypnotic Visions.** One creature of the froghemoth's choice within 60 feet of it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is mesmerized by otherworldly visions and has the charmed condition until the end of the target's next turn. While charmed in this way, the target has the incapacitated condition, and its speed is 0.  

## Regional effects


The region within 1 mile of a froghemoth elder's lair is altered by the froghemoth's unearthly presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Alien Flora.** Strange, invasive plants with bright colors and odd patterns sprout up around the lair.  
- **Mutations.** Wildlife encountered near the lair often sport mutations, such as extra limbs or eyes, glowing secretions, or vestigial tentacles.  

If the froghemoth elder dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
