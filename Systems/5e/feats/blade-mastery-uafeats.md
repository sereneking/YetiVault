# Blade Mastery
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 2*  

You master the [shortsword](/Systems/5e/items/shortsword.md), [longsword](/Systems/5e/items/longsword.md), [scimitar](/Systems/5e/items/scimitar.md), [rapier](/Systems/5e/items/rapier.md), and [greatsword](/Systems/5e/items/greatsword.md). You gain the following benefits when using any of them:

- You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls you make with the weapon.  
- On your turn, you can use your reaction to assume a parrying stance, provided you have the weapon in hand. Doing so grants you a +1 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you're not holding the weapon.  
- When you make an opportunity attack with the weapon, you have advantage on the attack roll.
