# Sea Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Create Coral Wall.** The dragon creates an opaque wall of living coral on a solid surface it can see within 120 feet of it. The wall can be up to 30 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its area is pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space on whichever side of the wall it wants, and it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While the wall remains, any creature that touches the wall must also make the saving throw. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 30 hp, resistance to fire damage, and immunity to poison damage and psychic damage. The wall lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  
- **Invoke the Sea's Calm.** The currents around up to four creatures in the water and that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it work against the creatures. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or it can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Whirlpools.** Four vortexes of water appear centered on points underwater or on the water's surface that the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each vortex takes the shape of a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 5-foot radius. Each creature that enters a vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature, including a restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. The vortexes last until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a legendary sea dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Chill of the Deeps.** Water temperatures drop within 1 mile of the dragon's lair, turning the water frigid and endangering swimming creatures not accustomed to arctic waters.  
- **Tempestuous Weather.** Storms and rough water are more common within 6 miles of the lair.  
- **Thriving Waterways.** Sea life becomes richer within 6 miles of the lair. Schools of fish move into new waters, sharks become common, and whale migration paths shift to pass near the area.  

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
