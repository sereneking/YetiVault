# Hierarchy; Order Reputation
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 97* 

**Order Reputation**

`dice: [](hierarchy-order-reputation-erlw.md#^order-reputation)`

| dice: d6 | Reputation |
|----------|------------|
| 1 | **Faithful Few**. You are seen as righteous crusaders, upholding the highest ideals of your faith and doing the gods' work in the world. Your deeds and methods are rarely, if ever, questioned. |
| 2 | **Respectable**. Your behavior and beliefs are in line with the hierarchy's expectations. As long as you stay in line, no one gives you trouble. |
| 3 | **Troublemakers**. You attract unwanted attention to your order or hierarchy from outside, so you are under a great deal of pressure to keep a low profile. |
| 4 | **Rebels**. You flout the dictates of your hierarchyâ€”even if it's for just reasons. Your superiors constantly try to rein you in. |
| 5 | **Reformers**. You bring a much-needed breath of fresh air into the ranks of your faith. If only more people of faith would act as you do! |
| 6 | **Anathema**. For right or wrong, your behavior and beliefs are viewed as unacceptable, and the hierarchy of your faith actively opposes your work. |
