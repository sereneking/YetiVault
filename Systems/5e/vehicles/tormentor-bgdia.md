## Traits

**Crushing Wheels** The Tormentor can move through the space of any Medium or smaller creature. When it does, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).If the creature was already [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), it takes an extra 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage.This trait can't be used against a particular creature more than once each turn.

**Magic Weapons** The Tormentor's weapon attacks are magical.

**Prone Deficiency** If the Tormentor rolls over and falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), it can't right itself and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until flipped upright.

**Raking Scythes** When the Tormentor moves within 5 feet of a creature that isn't [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) or another vehicle for the first time on a turn, it can rake the creature or vehicle with its protruding blades for 13 (`2d10 + 2`) slashing damage. A creature moves out of the way and takes no damage if it succeeds on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw.A vehicle moves out of the way and takes no damage if its driver succeeds on the saving throw.

## Action Stations

**Helm (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Three-Quarters Cover)** Drive and steer the Tormentor

**Harpoon Flinger (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Half Cover)** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d8 + 2`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

**Juke** If the Tormentor is able to move, the driver can use its reaction to grant the Tormentor advantage on a Dexterity saving throw.
