| 2 | Commanded by a fallen angel (lawful evil [planetar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md)) who runs a rival tavern, a gaggle of [imps](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/imp.md) begins vandalizing the "Bleeding Horn". The [ice devil](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/ice-devil.md) Sparax pays characters to deal with the situation. |
