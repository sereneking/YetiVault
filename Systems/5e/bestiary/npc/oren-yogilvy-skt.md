# Oren Yogilvy
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 252*  

Oren came to Northfurrow's End looking for easy work and found it. He sings for his supper, drinks like a fish, and wan ders the fields at night dreaming up new lyrics to entertain the inn's other guests. Oren likes to stir up trouble from time to time, but he doesn't have a mean bone in his body.

Ideal:"Music is food for the soul."

Bond:"You had me at ?Can I buy you a drink?'"

Flaw:"I have a knack for putting myself in harm's way. Good thing I'm lucky!"
