# Amulet of Betrayal
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


You can use a bonus action to move one of the following conditions from yourself to an ally within 60 feet of you: [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned), [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). When transferring [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion), move all your [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) levels. If the chosen ally is immune to a transferred condition, the transfer fails.
