# Hundun
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 237*  

*A toothless mouth adorns the headless shoulders of this oversized, four-armed, doughy humanoid. Colors and half-formed phantasmal shapes appear and vanish around it, to the creature's obvious delight.*

## Creative Chaos

Wise yet child-like creatures of chaos, hunduns are four-armed, headless humanoids that embody spontaneous creation and the confusion that precedes enlightenment. Taking delight in creation of all kinds, they bring change to the staid and stagnant, spin revelation from confusion, and inspire moments of great creation—from works of art to new nations and faiths, and even the formation of planets and planes.

## Nonsense Speech

Although not mindless, hunduns rarely seem to act out of conscious thought; however, their actions seem wise and are usually benevolent. They communicate only in nonsense words but have no trouble communicating among themselves or acting in coordination with other celestials.

## Flesh of Creation

Hundun blood is a powerful catalyst, and their spittle is a potent drug. Each hundun's heart is an Egg of Worlds—an artifact that can give birth to new concepts, powers, or even worlds. Obviously, the hundun must die for its heart to be used this way, but this is a sacrifice one might make willingly under the right circumstances.

## Traits

***Inscrutable.*** The hundun is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as any divination spell that it refuses. Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks made to ascertain the hundun's intentions or sincerity have disadvantage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The hundun has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Radiant Fists.*** The hundun's Slam attacks are magical. When the hundun hits with a Slam attack, the attack deals an extra `2d6` radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Spellcasting.*** The hundun casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [create or destroy water](/Systems/5e/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md), [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md), [prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md)

**1/day each**: [creation](/Systems/5e/spells/creation.md) (as an action), [plant growth](/Systems/5e/spells/plant-growth.md)

**3/day each**: [Evard's black tentacles](/Systems/5e/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md), [fabricate](/Systems/5e/spells/fabricate.md) (as an action), [Otto's irresistible dance](/Systems/5e/spells/ottos-irresistible-dance.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hundun can use its Motivating Babble. It then makes four Slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) radiant damage.

***Motivating Babble.*** The hundun babbles incoherently at one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer one of the following effects until the end of its next turn. Roll a `d4` to determine which effect happens.

***1 Distracted.*** The target is distracted with a flood of new ideas and has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

***2 Enlightened.*** The target's mind fills with solutions to many of its problems, reducing its burden on itself. Its speed is increased by half, and its jump distance is doubled.

***3 Inspired.*** The target is inspired by new ideas and has advantage on attack rolls and saving throws.

***4 Struck with Genius.*** The target's speed is reduced to 0 and it must use its next action to write itself a note, tie a small knot, or create some other physical reminder of the great idea that just struck it.
