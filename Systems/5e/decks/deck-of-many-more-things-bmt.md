# Deck of Many More Things
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 51*  

Over the centuries since the first [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md) was created, many have sought and failed to replicate it. But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in "chapter 2".)

Like the [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md), the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md) as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.

Before you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.

As soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.

Unless it is the [Fool](/Systems/5e/decks/deck-of-many-more-things-bmt.md#Fool) or the [Jester](/Systems/5e/decks/deck-of-many-more-things-bmt.md#Jester) card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.

The DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire. Alternatively, roll on the Deck of Many More Things table below to randomly determine what cards are drawn.

## Cards

### Aberration

You gain telepathy within a range of 90 feet.

### Balance
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/02-balance.webp#card)
Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.

### Beast
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/03-beast.webp#card)
You immediately transform into a random Beast with a CR of 5 or lower. Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.

You remain transformed in this way for `2d12` days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.

### Book

You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

### Celestial

### Construct
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/10-construct.webp#card)
A [homunculus](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/homunculus.md) appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.

### Corpse
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/11-corpse.webp#card)
You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell.

### Crossroads
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/12-crossroads.webp#card)
Roll a `d20`. If the roll is even, you age `1d10` years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by `1d10` years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

### Door
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/14-door.webp#card)

The card's [medusa](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md)-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the [Fates](/Systems/5e/decks/deck-of-many-more-things-bmt.md#Fates) card can end this curse.

### Expert
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/18-expert.webp#card)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/19-fates.webp#card)
Reality's fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card's magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

### Fey
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/20-fey.webp#card)
A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.

The fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.

### Fiend
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/21-fiend.webp#card)
A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.

### Flames
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/22-flames.webp#card)

You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

### Gem
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/24-gem.webp#card)

You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

### Lance

At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.

### Maze

A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you.

A [gelatinous cube](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/gelatinous-cube.md) immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/42-prisoner.webp#card)
Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the [Dispel Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell or similar magic. However, a [Disintegrate](/Systems/5e/spells/disintegrate.md) spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using [thieves' tools](/Systems/5e/items/thieves-tools.md).

### Puzzle

### Ring
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/44-ring.webp#card)
A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.

### Rogue
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/45-rogue.webp#card)
A nonplayer character of the DM's choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn't known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention can end the NPC's hostility toward you.

### Ruin
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/46-ruin.webp#card)
All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

### Sage
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/47-sage.webp#card)
At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.

### Shield
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/48-shield.webp#card)
A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.

### Ship

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/50-skull.webp#card)
You summon an [avatar of death](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/avatar-of-death-dmg.md)—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the DM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own [avatar of death](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/avatar-of-death-dmg.md). A creature slain by an [avatar of death](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/avatar-of-death-dmg.md) can't be restored to life.

### Staff

You immediately have the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the [Greater Restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic.

### Sun

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/58-temple.webp#card)
A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the [Resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/resurrection.md) spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.

### Throne
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/59-throne.webp#card)
You gain proficiency in the [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.

### Tomb

At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the [True Resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).

### Tower
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/61-tower.webp#card)
Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.

### Tree
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/62-tree.webp#card)
Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the [Wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.

### Undead
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/63-undead.webp#card)
Somewhere on the Material Plane, a [revenant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/revenant.md) rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge.

### Void
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/DMTCRG/Deck%20of%20Many%20More%20Things/64-void.webp#card)
This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). A [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell can't restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.

### Warrior
