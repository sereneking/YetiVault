|----------|--------|
| 1 | Shadowy forces steal a holy artifact, thought to be a part of the sun, from Heliod's followers. The priesthood blames Phenax or Erebos, but Kruphix is behind the theft. The sun stone holds a terrible secret power, and Kruphix seeks to remove it from the mortal world before it does great harm. |
| 2 | Kruphix sends Nyxborn to torment a community. The locals are baffled, until it's revealed that miners have impeded on a cave that underpins the nature of time. Not only are mortals not welcome there, but someone has already entered, employed the passages there, and stolen something from the past. |
| 3 | A philosopher in Meletis argues that the gods rely on mortals for their existence, rather than the other way around. When this idea gains adherents, Kruphix curses the polis so that no one can speak or read. |
| 4 | After a minor altercation between the gods, Kruphix declares a new Silence. He refuses to lift it unless the other gods agree to aid him in forcing Klothys back into the Underworld. |
