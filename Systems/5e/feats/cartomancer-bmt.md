# Cartomancer
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 49*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level, Spellcasting feature

You have learned to channel your magic through a deck of cards. You can use a card deck as your spellcasting focus, and you gain the following benefits:

- **Card Tricks.** You learn the [Prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md) cantrip and can use it to create illusions that duplicate the effects of stage magic. When you use [Prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md) in this way, you can conceal the verbal and somatic components of the spell as ordinary conversation and card handling.  
- **Hidden Ace.** When you finish a long rest, you can choose one spell from your class's spell list and imbue that spell into a card. The chosen spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and it must be a level for which you have spell slots. The card remains imbued with this spell for 8 hours. While the card is imbued with the spell, you can use a bonus action to flourish the card and cast the spell within. The card then immediately loses its magic.
