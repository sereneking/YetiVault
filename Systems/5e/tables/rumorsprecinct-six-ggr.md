| 1 | "Something very large was lurking in the chasm last night, and it knocked a carriage off a bridge. The passengers jumped out just in time!" |
| 2 | "I heard that Krenko's gang has been trying to get their hands on mizzium, and are willing to pay a good price for it too." |
| 3 | "The wight of Precinct Six has struck again! This morning, an arrester and a cutpurse were found dead in an alley, drained of their life. A bystander saw it happen." |
| 4 | "Did you hear those shrieking sounds out near Benzer's Bridge last night? Whatever it was, it didn't sound like anything I've ever heard before. Chilling." |
| 5 | "I hear Rhionna is closing up her forge. She says she's getting sick of replacing stolen tools every week. The staff claims they're innocent." |
| 6 | "One of the warehouses out in Medori Park had an intense red glow shining through its windows yesterday. Smelled of sulfur. No one wants to go near it." |
