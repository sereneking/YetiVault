# Lifewell Tattoo
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This tattoo comprises symbols of life and rebirth. While this tattoo is on your skin, you have resistance to necrotic damage.

## Death Ward

When you would be reduced to 0 hit points, you drop to 1 hit point instead. Once used, this benefit can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Tattoo Attunement

To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin. If you have multiple magic tattoos, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in the closest unoccupied space to you.
