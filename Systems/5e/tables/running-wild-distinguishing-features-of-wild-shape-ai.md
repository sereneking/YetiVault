| dice: d6 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Your pelt is rich hues of gold and silver so bright that they reflect light. |
| 2 | When you take wild shape form, it's a painful, squelchy process that usually leaves your fellow adventurers queasy. |
| 3 | Your wild shape forms all wear an identical ceremonial bracelet on one limb, decorated with teeth. |
| 4 | A dark patch on your body is recognizable as the silhouette of [Omin Dran](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/omin-dran-ai.md) |
| 5 | You always have twigs, leaves, and other refuse tangled in your fur or hair. |
| 6 | When you switch back to your normal form, one hand always manages to retain its fur or feathers for a short while. |
