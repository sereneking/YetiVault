# Faevlin

## Salvage

Faevlins love to collect objects that increase their personal prestige and power. Every faevlin is likely to have a few personal trinkets like this, along with the occasional item of real worth.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** A faevlin can teleport away from attackers but does so in a manner even the faevlin can't predict.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** Faevlins are goblins cursed by powerful fey magic  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** A faevlin can't be charmed by nonfey, but they have been known to pretend to be charmed to trick the enchanter.

## Traits

***Fey Touched.*** Magic can't put the faevlin to sleep. Only a creature of the fey type can cause the faevlin to become [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and a faevlin always knows if a nonfey creature attempted to render it [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed).

***Sneaky.*** The faevlin can use a bonus action to take the Hide action.

## Actions

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Fey Fade.*** When an attack misses a faevlin, the faevlin can teleport up to 30 feet in a random direction, arriving in a safe, unoccupied space.
