# Telekinetic
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 81*  

You learn to move things with your mind, granting you the following benefits:

- You learn the [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible). If you already know this spell, its range increases by 30 feet when you cast it. Its spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.  
- As a bonus action, you can try to telekinetically shove one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the score increased by this feat) or be moved 5 feet toward you or away from you. A creature can willingly fail this save.
