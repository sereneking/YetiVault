# Snare (UA)
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, 30 feet of cord or rope, which is consumed by the spell
- **Duration:** Until dispelled or triggered

While you cast this spell, you use the cord or rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on a flat surface within your reach. When you finish casting, the cord or rope disappears to become a magical trap.

The trap is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC to be found. The trap triggers when a Small creature or larger moves into the area protected by the spell.

The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) and be hoisted into the air until it hangs upside down 3 feet above the protected surface, where it is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained).

The [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can make a Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage at the end of each of its turns and ends the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) effect on a success. Alternatively, another creature that can reach the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can use an action to make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) effect also ends.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
