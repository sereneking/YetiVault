# Gunsmith
*[Artificer](artificer-uaartificer.md): Artificer Specialist*  
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 6*  


## Class Features

### Gunsmith (Level 1)

A master of engineering, you forge a firearm powered by a combination of science and magic.

### Master Smith (Level 1)

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with [smith's tools](/Systems/5e/items/smiths-tools.md), and you learn the mending cantrip.

### Thunder Cannon (Level 1)

At 1st level, you forge a deadly firearm using a combination of arcane magic and your knowledge of engineering and metallurgy. This firearm is called a Thunder Cannon. It is a ferocious weapon that fires leaden bullets that can punch through armor with ease.

You are proficient with the Thunder Cannon. The firearm is a two-handed ranged weapon that deals `2d6` piercing damage. Its normal range is 150 feet, and its maximum range if 500 feet. Once fired, it must be reloaded as a bonus action.

If you lose your Thunder Cannon, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of metal and other raw materials.

### Arcane Magazine (Level 1)

At 1st level, you craft a leather bag used to carry your tools and ammunition for your Thunder Cannon. Your Arcane Magazine includes the powders, lead shot, and other materials needed to keep that weapon functioning.

You can use the Arcane Magazine to produce ammunition for your gun. At the end of each long rest, you can magically produce 40 rounds of ammunition with this magazine. After each short rest, you can produce 10 rounds.

If you lose your Arcane Magazine, you can create a new one as part of a long rest, using 25 gp of leather and other raw materials.

### Thunder Monger (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn to channel thunder energy into your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with your Thunder Cannon that deals an extra `1d6` thunder damage on a hit.

This extra damage increases by `1d6` when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (`2d6`), 7th level (`3d6`), 9th level (`4d6`), 11th level (`5d6`), 13th level (`6d6`), 15th level (`7d6`), 17th level (`8d6`), and 19th level (`9d6`).

### Blast Wave (Level 9)

Starting at 9th level, you can channel force energy into your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with it. Rather than making an attack roll, you unleash force energy in a 15-foot cone from the gun. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed saving throw, a target takes `2d6` force damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.

This damage increases by `1d6` when you reach certain levels in this class: 13th level (`3d6`) and 17th level (`4d6`).

### Piercing Round (Level 14)

Starting at 14th level, you can shoot lightning energy through your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with it. Rather than making an attack roll, you cause the gun to unleash a bolt of lightning, 5-feet wide and 30-feet long. Each creature in that area must make Dexterity saving throws with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed saving throw, a target takes `4d6` lightning damage. This damage increases to `6d6` when you reach 19th level in this class.

### Explosive Round (Level 17)

Starting at 17th level, you can channel fiery energy into your Thunder Cannon. As an action, you can make a special attack with it. Rather than making an attack roll, you launch an explosive round from the gun. The round detonates in a 30-foot radius sphere at a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier. On a failed saving throw, a target takes `4d8` fire damage.
