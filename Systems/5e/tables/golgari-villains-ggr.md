`dice: [](golgari-villains-ggr.md#^golgari-villains)`

| dice: d8 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Armed with a powerful magic item found among the dead in the undercity, a [Golgari shaman](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/golgari-shaman-ggr.md) enacts a plan of revenge against another guild. |
| 2 | A [kraul death priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kraul-death-priest-ggr.md) is seeking a way to revive the ancient gods of Ravnica and destroy the world. |
| 3 | A [Devkarin lich](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/devkarin-lich-ggr.md) is capturing living subjects and infecting them with an insidious, mind-controlling fungus. |
| 4 | A trophy-hunting [undercity medusa](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/undercity-medusa-ggr.md) for the stat block) is on a killing spree, petrifying victims in interesting poses. |
| 5 | A [Golgari shaman](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/golgari-shaman-ggr.md) is spreading a fungal infection that transforms its dead victims into [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md). |
| 6 | An elf child lures citizens into the sewers, where a monstrous "pet" is waiting to kill and eat them. |
| 7 | Pursuing a personal vendetta, an Ochran [assassin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/assassin.md) is targeting members of a certain guild and trying to ensure that their bodies are never found. |
| 8 | A [kraul death priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kraul-death-priest-ggr.md), angry at the way the Golgari have treated the kraul in the past, is killing the elves and medusas of the guild, hoping to eventually take Jarad's place as guildmaster. |
