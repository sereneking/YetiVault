## Salvage

The touch of an Aether Kindred's dreams can taint objects with an unstable nature, particularly potions. Any potion found on the servants of these beings has a 50 percent chance to be tainted, making the potion's effects unpredictable. Someone inspecting such a potion must succeed on a DC 17 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to identify the instability. Otherwise, the potion appears to be a normal potion of its type.

When an unstable potion is consumed, roll on the Eldritch Effects table to determine the effect of the instability, which is in addition to the potion's normal effects and can last as long as the potion does or 1 minute, whichever is longer. However, a creature can attempt a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the instability effect on itself on a success.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** In the wake of the gods' disappearance, some turned to other ancient entities for power. Those that succeed are known as eldritch priests.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** These priests draw their power from maddening entities known as the Aether Kindred, which some arcane scholars point to as the cause of the gods' disappearance. The power granted by such creatures can produce bizarre and unpredictable effects.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** Some eldritch priests seek to awaken their new "gods" by spreading the story of the demise of members the Etharis pantheon. As more people tap into the dreams of the slumbering Kindred, the creatures begin to rouse. If they wake, the world is doomed.

***Prophecy of Doom (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The eldritch herald chooses a point it can see within 120 feet of it and rolls on the Eldritch Effects table. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to an eldritch effect for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
