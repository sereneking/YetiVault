# Accelerated Rests
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 213* 

Certain adventures thrive on the adrenaline of the chase or the ever-present fear of ambush. As it stands, the need to take a short rest can prove difficult during long dungeon crawls, and this lends itself to a nice tone of personal stress and risk versus reward. However, sometimes a rest is necessary for the party to continue, even if the current rush of the story's clock won't allow for the hour that a short rest requires.

One way to make short rests less intrusive is to let characters take one in a reduced amount of time. If the characters have only 10 minutes to spare, let them take a 10-minute short rest. If they have half an hour to spare, let them take a short rest in 30 minutes. This fits the game mechanics to the story's narrative, rather than the other way around.

In a campaign that implements this option, a character must finish a long rest before they can take an accelerated short rest again.

## Arduous Rally

If fudging game mechanics to support the campaign's narrative doesn't feel right for your group, the characters can potentially make use of the option to take an arduous rally instead of a short rest. This involves one or more characters spending 5 minutes to rally their resolve in the face of coming peril, letting their adrenaline fuel the need to push on. A character who undertakes an arduous rally gains the benefit of a short rest, but any hit points restored by spending Hit Dice are halved. Moreover, the character gains one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).
