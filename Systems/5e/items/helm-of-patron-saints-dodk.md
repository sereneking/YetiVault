# Helm of Patron Saints
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


While wearing this helm, you can see invisible creatures and objects within 60 feet of you. In addition, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls, and increase your spell saving throw DC by 2.

## Relics of Saint Vitruvio

These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.

A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the [heal](/Systems/5e/spells/heal.md) spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio.
