## Traits

***Shared Resistances.*** When you summon the dragon, choose one of its damage resistances. You have resistance to the chosen damage type until the spell ends.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Breath Weapon, and it makes a number of Bite and Claw attacks equal to half the spell's level (rounded down).

***Bite and Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d6 + 4 + summonSpellLevel` piercing damage.

***Breath Weapon.*** The dragon exhales a stream of multicolored energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking `2d6` damage of your choice of a damage type this dragon has resistance to on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
