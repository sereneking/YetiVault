# Fire Hellion

Fire giants study war in its many forms across the multiverse, which sometimes leads the giants to a fascination with the Blood Warâ€”the endless conflict between demons and devils across the Lower Planes. Such a giant might enter into a pact with a powerful devil, hoping to learn tactics the devils have fine-tuned over millennia and to acquire magical gifts to help the giant rise in the ordning.

Over time, the giant is corrupted, becoming a Fiend in its own right. The devil teaches the giant how to forge with infernal iron and hellfire, enabling the giant to craft weapons that can funnel the souls of the slain to Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. In this way, the devil stands to gain a constant supply of souls from the giant's enemies, as well as the promise that the giant will serve the devil as a smith in the Nine Hells after death.

The corrupted fire giant takes on fiendish features, including horns, cloven hooves for feet, and a forked tail.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The hellion has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Soul Taker.*** A Giant or a Humanoid that is reduced to 0 hit points by the hellion dies, and its soul rises as a lemure (see the Monster Manual) on Avernus, one of the Nine Hells, in `1d4` hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, it can be restored to life only by a [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell or by killing the lemure and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hellion makes two Morningstar attacks.

***Morningstar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d8 + 7`) piercing damage plus 11 (`2d10`) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it can't regain hit points until the start of the hellion's next turn.

***Infernal Orb.*** The hellion hurls a magical ball of fire that explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the hellion can see within 120 feet of itself. The sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 18 (`4d8`) fire damage and 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
