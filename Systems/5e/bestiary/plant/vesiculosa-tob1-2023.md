# Vesiculosa
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 385*  

*A glittering pool stands among lush and verdant fruiting plants.*

## Underground Oasis

A vesiculosa is a huge, burrowing pitcher plant that dwells in deserts and oases, spurring nearby growth and luring in prey with soporific scents and tainted water. A vesiculosa's body is buried in the ground, with only its roots in the open in ropy tangles. It leaves the mouth of its water-filled central pitcher open on the surface of the ground, looking like a small oasis. When creatures fall to its sleep-inducing water, the vesiculosa uses its roots to pull them into the soil, waiting for them to die before feasting on the nutrients left by the decaying flesh.

## Rich Sapphire Heartvine

A vesiculosa's heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists. It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging once the plant has been killed.

## Traits

***Oasis Appearance.*** While the vesiculosa remains motionless and partially submerged on the surface of sand or soil, it is indistinguishable from a small oasis or pond. The vesiculosa's pitcher produces enough water for plants to grow around it, provided the vesiculosa remains in the area for an extended period of time. A creature that eats a fruit from a plant growing in the vesiculosa's water is affected by the Sweet Water trait as if it drank the water.

***Sweet Fragrance.*** When a creature that can smell the vesiculosa's sweet fragrance starts its turn within 30 feet of the vesiculosa, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), the creature must move on its turn toward the vesiculosa by the safest available route to get within 5 feet of the plant and drink its water. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the vesiculosa's Sweet Fragrance for the next 24 hours.

***Sweet Water.*** A creature that drinks water from the vesiculosa's pitcher regains 5 `2d4` hp, reduces its [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) level by 1, and must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 10 minutes. An [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake. Drinking the water provides a creature enough nourishment to sustain it for one day.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vesiculosa makes four Root or Spit Sweet Water attacks.

***Root.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (`3d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16). Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The vesiculosa has four roots, each of which can grapple only one target.

***Spit Sweet Water.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 20/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (`3d10 + 2`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Bonus Actions

***Bury.*** One creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the vesiculosa is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), dragged into the ground, and buried just below the surface, ending the grapple. The buried creature is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to breathe or stand up. A creature, including the buried creature, can take its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 16 Strength check. This bonus action doesn't wake a creature that is [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) from the vesiculosa's Sweet Water trait or Spit Sweet Water action.
