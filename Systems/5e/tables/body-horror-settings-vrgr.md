**Body Horror Settings**

`dice: [](body-horror-settings-vrgr.md#^body-horror-settings)`

| dice: d8 | Setting |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A country of red muscle, with bleeding eyes embedded in the hair-strangled trees |
| 2 | A world of monuments and houses, all made of flesh |
| 3 | A domain ordinary save for the abundance of black hair, the strands always moving even when there is no breeze |
| 4 | A neighborhood of derelict houses, each one composed of numerous mimics |
| 5 | An ocean of undead leviathans, still moving despite the entrails bubbling from their burst torsos |
| 6 | A forest of black pines draped in bodies |
| 7 | A slaughterhouse larger than it appears on the outside, full of victims mutely awaiting slaughter |
| 8 | A system of subterranean tunnels, their walls spackled with fossils or mummified organs |
