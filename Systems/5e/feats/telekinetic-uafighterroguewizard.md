# Telekinetic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Rogue, and Wizard p. 8*  

You learn to move things with your mind. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn the [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip. You can cast it without verbal or somatic components, and you can make the spectral hand invisible.  
- As a bonus action, you can try to shove one creature you can see within 5 feet of the spectral hand created by your [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) spell. When you do so, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be pushed 5 feet away from you.
