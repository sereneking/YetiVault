- **Fuming.** The fey has advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of this turn.  
- **Mirthful.** The fey can force one creature it can see within 10 feet of it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. Unless the save succeeds, the target is [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you and the fey for 1 minute or until the target takes any damage.  
- **Tricksy.** The fey can fill a 5-foot cube within 5 feet of it with magical darkness, which lasts until the end of its next turn.
