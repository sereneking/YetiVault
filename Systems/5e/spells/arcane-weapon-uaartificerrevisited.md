# Arcane Weapon
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You channel arcane energy into one simple or martial weapon you're holding, and choose one damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d6` damage of the chosen type to any target you hit with the weapon. If the weapon isn't magical, it becomes a magic weapon for the spell's duration.

As a bonus action, you can change the damage type, choosing from the options above.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can maintain your [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on the spell for up to 8 hours.

**Classes**: [Artificer (Revisited)](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-revisited-uaartificerrevisited.md), [Artificer](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-tce.md)
