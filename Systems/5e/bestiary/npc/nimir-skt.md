## Traits

***Roleplaying Information.*** Nimir is an insightful, even-keeled storm giant who believes that a lasting alliance between giants and small folk can make the world a safer, more enlightened place. He believes King Hekaton was wise to choose Princess Serissa as his heir apparent, and it would never occur to him to question their orders.

Ideal: "It's the duty of the big to protect the small."

Bond: "I'd give my life to defend my king and his royal line."

Flaw: "I never question orders."

***Amphibious.*** Nimir can breathe air and water.

***Spellcasting.*** Nimir casts one of the following spells, requiring no material spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md), [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) (cast as 1 action), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Nimir makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`6d6 + 9`) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`4d12 + 9`) bludgeoning damage.

***Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).*** Nimir hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
