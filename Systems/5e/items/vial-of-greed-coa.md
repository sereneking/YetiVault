# Vial of Greed
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


This small glass vial can stockpile resources for use in the future. Once stored, resources last for 1 century before vanishing. As an action you make the vial store any number of the following resources, which are magically consumed and converted into a violet-colored liquid:

- Up to 31 days of food and/or drink. The flavors are lost, instead becoming tasteless.  
- Up to 7 days of alcohol. The flavors are lost, instead becoming tasteless.  
- Up to 5 magic scrolls that affect a single creature. The target of the spell is you, and if the spell requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), you can concentrate.  
- Up to 5 magic potions. No more than 2 duplicate potions can be stored at a time.  

You may have more than one kind of resource in the vial, up to the limits expressed above. You can use a bonus action to consume one day of food (or alcohol) or activate one scroll or magic potion. If activating a magic scroll, the effects of that scroll must end before you can activate another scroll from the Vial of Greed.
