**Leaving the Mror Holds**

`dice: [](dwarves-of-the-mror-holds-leaving-the-mror-holds-erlw.md#^leaving-the-mror-holds)`

| dice: d8 | Reason for Leaving |
|----------|--------------------|
| 1 | A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down. |
| 2 | You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world. |
| 3 | Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down. |
| 4 | You're pursuing a vendetta with a personal rival, seeking to defeat them either in battle or in business. |
| 5 | You're searching for a legendary dwarven artifact, stolen centuries ago by a Karrnish noble. |
| 6 | You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home. |
| 7 | You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves. |
| 8 | You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr. |
