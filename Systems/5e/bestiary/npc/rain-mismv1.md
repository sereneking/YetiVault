# Rain
*Source: Misplaced Monsters: Volume 1 p. 8*  

> [!note]
> Created by Kenzie C.

Rain lives in happy meadows atop clouds, away from all the evil of the world. She loves cupcakes and readily accepts them as gifts. She has fiery wings and a tiny halo around the tip of her horn. When confronted by bullies or evildoers, she can emit rainbow-colored positive energy from her haloed horn. Rain uses her rainbows to heal friendly creatures and punish evildoers, transforming the latter into glittering flowers.

## Traits

***Fiery Wings.*** Rain's wings are made of flame, and they shed bright light out to 15 feet and dim light for an additional 15 feet. At the start of each of Rain's turns, each creature of Rain's choice within 5 feet of her takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage. A creature that hits Rain with a melee attack takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** Rain has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Rain makes two Hoof attacks.

***Hoof.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`2d4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Haloed Horn Burst (Recharge 5-6).*** Rain uses her haloed horn to produce one of the following magical effects:

***Glitterstorm.*** Rain emits a rainbow beam in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one; creatures of evil alignment have disadvantage on this saving throw. If the damage from this effect reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and its body turns into glittery flowers.

***Healing Rainbows.*** Rain releases a wave of rejuvenating multicolored light in a 30-foot cone. Each creature of Rain's choice in that area regains 18 (`4d8`) hit points.

## Bonus Actions

***Nimble Escape.*** Rain takes either the Disengage or the Hide action.
