# Tyrannosaurus Rex
*Source: Monster Manual p. 80, Tomb of Annihilation, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, Sigil and the Outlands, Dungeons of Drakkenheim, Quests from the Infinite Staircase. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, and there are few creatures it won't try to devour whole. While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that try to dart in to steal its meal.

## Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs, or behemoths, are among the oldest reptiles in the world. Predatory dinosaurs are savage, territorial hunters. Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.

Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.

Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.
