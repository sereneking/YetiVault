**Guild Contacts**

`dice: [](adventurers-guild-contacts-guild-contacts-erlw.md#^guild-contacts)`

| dice: d10 | Contact |
|-----------|---------|
| 1 | The charismatic leader of the guild, who doesn't actually do very much except inspire and encourage members |
| 2 | A retired adventurer who works hard to connect member groups with employment opportunities that match their skills |
| 3 | A petty rival who continually tries to claim jobs, bounties, and rewards before you can |
| 4 | A bitter enemy who nurtures a grudge over some past wrong (real or imagined) and does everything possible to undermine you |
| 5 | A naive adventurer who admires you and tries to emulate you in every way |
| 6 | A hardened adventurer who thinks a moral compass is akin to a pair of manacles |
| 7 | An injured retired adventurer who can't quite let go of the adventuring life and experiences it vicariously by spending time in the guildhall |
| 8 | A grouchy employee who keeps the guildhall clean and cares for its guests while quietly complaining about how adventurers should "grow up," get a "real job," and contribute to society |
| 9 | A kindly mentor who loves to tell stories of past exploits in front of the guildhall fireplace |
| 10 | A sad, older adventurer who tells cautionary tales in the vain hope that younger members avoid making the same mistakes |
