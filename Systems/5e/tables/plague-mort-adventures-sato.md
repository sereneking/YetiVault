| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Disguised as a cleric of a sun god, a [deva](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/deva.md) from Excelsior begins proselytizing among hopeful townsfolk in secret. Archlector Bex commands the characters to capture the missionary and deliver them to the Pit. |
| 2 | A farmer pays the characters to prune a patch of pustules from a field before the harvest is spoiled. Dozens of [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) lurk within the maze of stalks. |
| 3 | Armed with a forked spear, the vindictive Martari Mayhem (lawful evil, tiefling [gladiator](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) plans to storm "Blightsteel Keep". At the "Razed Altar", she hires the characters to infiltrate the stronghold and report on its defenses. |
| 4 | Alorio Nightriddle (chaotic evil, human [mage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) invites the characters to a clandestine meeting at A Pinch of Salt, a rundown tavern with a [glabrezu](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/glabrezu.md) proprietor. Alorio wants their help to oust the archlector. |
