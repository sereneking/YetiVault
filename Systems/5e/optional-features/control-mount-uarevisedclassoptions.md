# Control Mount
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 3*  

When you make a Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) check to influence a creature that you or an ally is riding, you can expend one superiority die, roll it, and add the number rolled to the check. You can do this before or after rolling the `d20`, but before applying the results of the check.
