# Mage of Witherbloom (UA)
*[Druid](druid.md): Druid Circle*  
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2021 Mages of Strixhaven p. 8*  


## Class Features

### Mage of Witherbloom (Level 1)

*Druid and Warlock Subclass*

Mages of Witherbloom draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some Witherbloom adherents focus on vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.

#### Using This Subclass
_Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2021 Mages of Strixhaven_

Upon selecting the Mage of Witherbloom subclass, you gain two features: Witherbloom Spells and Essence Tap.

In this subclass's features, any reference to your class refers to the class from which you gained the subclass. If you're a druid, the College of Witherbloom counts as your circle, and if you're a warlock, the college counts as your patron.

When you subsequently reach a level in your class that gives you a subclass feature, you gain one feature of your choice from the options presented here. Each feature has a class level prerequisite, as noted beneath its name. You must meet that prerequisite to gain the feature.

### Witherbloom Spells (Level 1)

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You learn the cantrip [spare the dying](/Systems/5e/spells/spare-the-dying.md) and the 1st-level spells [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md) and [inflict wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/inflict-wounds.md). You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Witherbloom Spells table.

Each of these spells count as a class spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells you know. If you are a druid, you always have the spells prepared, and they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

**Witherbloom Spells**

### Essence Tap (Level 1)

*Level 1+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

As a bonus action, you can draw on a reservoir of life essence to empower yourself for 1 minute, or until you use this feature again. For the duration, you gain one of the following benefits of your choice:

- **Overgrowth.** When you choose this benefit, and as a bonus action on subsequent turns while the benefit lasts, you can expend and roll one Hit Die. You regain a number of hit points equal to the number rolled plus your spellcasting ability modifier.  
- **Withering Strike.** When you deal damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and you ignore resistance to necrotic damage.  

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Witherbloom Brew (Level 6)

*Level 6+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

You gain proficiency with herbalism kits if you don't already have it.

When you finish a long rest, you can use an herbalism kit and a pot or cauldron to create magical brews. You create a number of brews equal to your proficiency bonus. Each brew requires its own flask. A brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. For each brew, choose one of the following effects:

- **Fortifying.** When you create this brew, choose a damage type from the following list: cold, fire, necrotic, poison, or radiant. A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient gains resistance to the chosen damage type for 1 hour.  
- **Quickening.** A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains `2d6` hit points, and one disease or condition from the following list affecting the recipient ends (brew user's choice): [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned).  
- **Toxifying.** As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The next time the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature within 1 hour, the target takes `2d6` poison damage and must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute.  

### Witherbloom Adept (Level 10)

*Level 10+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

Your connection to the flow of life force deepens. Once per turn when you deal necrotic damage or restore hit points using a spell, one target of the spell takes additional damage or regains additional hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

### Withering Vortex (Level 14)

*Level 14+ Mage of Witherbloom Feature*

When you cast a spell using a spell slot that deals necrotic damage to any number of creatures that aren't Undead or Constructs, choose one of the creatures that took damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
