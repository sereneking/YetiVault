| dice: d8 | Torment |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The Darklord is pockmarked with eyes that never close and never allow for sleep. |
| 2 | The Darklord suffers ever-growing, tumorous organs, the mass expanding beyond them to choke their dwelling. |
| 3 | The Darklord possesses a second starving mouth in their torso, one that howls unless fed. |
| 4 | The Darklord can't control their transformation into a beast and back. |
| 5 | The voices of those the Darklord have wronged scream endlessly from inside them. |
| 6 | The Darklord aches daily with a monstrous, unceasing hunger. |
| 7 | The Darklord is perpetually gravid with monstrous egg sacs that hatch waves of insects. |
| 8 | The Darklord has extraneous limbs that tear the Darklord apart then re-stitch the pieces. |
