# Yuan-Ti Pureblood Transformation
*Other*  

A human can be transformed into a yuan-ti pureblood. The transformation can be undone only by a [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell or divine intervention. A character who survives it gains a random form of [indefinite madness](/Systems/5e/tables/indefinite-madness.md) (see ""Madness"" in chapter 8 of the *Dungeon Master's Guide*). A human that undergoes and survives the ritual retains its traits and gains the following yuan-ti racial traits.

## Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Innate Spellcasting

You know the [poison spray](/Systems/5e/spells/poison-spray.md) cantrip. You can cast [animal friendship](/Systems/5e/spells/animal-friendship.md) an unlimited number of times with this trait, but you can target only snakes with it. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md) with this trait. Once you cast it, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

## Magic Resistance

You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Poison Immunity

You are immune to poison damage and the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition.
