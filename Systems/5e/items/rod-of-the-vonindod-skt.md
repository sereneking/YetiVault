# Rod of the Vonindod
*Rod, rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 100.0 lbs.

The [fire giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) Duke Zalto hired a wizard to craft several of these adamantine rods. Each measures 4 feet long, weighs 100 pounds, and is sized to fit comfortably in a [fire giant's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/fire-giant.md) hand. The rod has two prongs at one end and a molded handle grip on the opposite end.

The rod has 10 charges and regains `1d6 + 4` of its expended charges daily at dawn. As an action, you can grasp it by the handle and expend 1 charge to cast the [locate object](/Systems/5e/spells/locate-object.md) spell from it. When the rod is used to detect objects made of adamantine, such as fragments of the Vonindod construct, its range increases to 10 miles.
