# Orcsplitter
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf, fighter, or paladin of good alignment)*  

- **Damage**: 1d12 S

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

- You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  
- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an [orc](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md), that [orc](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.  
- You can't be [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) by [orcs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) while you're not [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). You are also aware when [orcs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.  
- You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) while you're not [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).  

## Sentience

Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision). It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

## Personality

Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face [orcs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, [orcs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md)—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.
