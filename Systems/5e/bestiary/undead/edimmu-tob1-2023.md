# Edimmu
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 154*  

*An evil wind swirls out of the desert, parching those it touches and whispering evil plans.*

## Bitter Exiles

Desert and plains tribes often exile their criminals to wander as outcasts. A banished criminal who dies of thirst sometimes rises as an edimmu, a hateful undead that blames all sentient living beings for its fate.

## Rise Again

Unless its body is found and given a proper burial, an edimmu is nearly impossible to destroy. Edimmus rarely venture more than a mile from their remains, but they sometimes follow prey they have cursed to seal the creature's fate. Once that creature is slain, they return to the site of their demise.

## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The edimmu can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Rejuvenation.*** If destroyed, an edimmu rises again in `2d4` days, regaining all its hp and becoming active again. When the edimmu rises, it appears within 5 feet of its remains. Only burying its mortal remains in consecrated or hallowed ground prevents this trait from functioning.

***Undead Nature.*** The edimmu doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Water Siphon.*** The edimmu has advantage on attack rolls against creatures made of or gaining power from magical water, such as water elementals, water jinnborn, water genies, and sorcerers with water-based origins. In addition, such creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw against the edimmu's Draining Touch and Multiattack.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The edimmu makes two Draining Touch attacks. If both attacks hit one creature that isn't a Construct or Undead, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). A creature that fails this saving throw by 5 or more is also [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.

***Draining Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest after drinking 1 pint of water. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0.
