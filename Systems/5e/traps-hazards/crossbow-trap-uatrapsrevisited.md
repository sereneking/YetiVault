# Crossbow Trap
*Generic Hazard*  

A crossbow trap is a favorite of kobolds and other creatures that rely on traps to defend their lairs. It consists of a tripwire run across a hallway and connected to a pair of carefully hidden heavy crossbows. The crossbows are aimed to fire down the hallway at anyone who triggers the tripwire.
