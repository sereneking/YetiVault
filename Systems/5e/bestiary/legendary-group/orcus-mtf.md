# Orcus

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Orcus can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Orcus's voice booms throughout the lair. His utterance causes one creature of his choice to be subjected to [power word kill](/Systems/5e/spells/power-word-kill.md). Orcus needn't see the creature, but he must be aware that the individual is in the lair.  
- Orcus causes up to six corpses within the lair to rise as [skeletons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md), [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), or [ghouls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md). These undead obey his telepathic commands, which can reach anywhere in the lair.  
- Orcus causes skeletal arms to rise from an area on the ground in a 20-foot square that he can see. They last until the next initiative count 20. Each creature in that area when the arms appear must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the arms disappear or until Orcus releases their grasp (no action required).  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing Orcus's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Dead beasts periodically animate as undead mockeries of their former selves. Skeletal and zombie versions of local wildlife are commonly seen in the area.  
- The air becomes filled with the stench of rotting flesh, and buzzing flies grow thick within the region, even when there is no carrion to be found.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Orcus table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Orcus dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

### Madness of Orcus

If a creature goes mad in Orcus's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Orcus table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.
