## Traits

### Creature Type

You are a Fey.

### Ram

You can use your head and horns to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals `1d6` + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Magic Resistance

You have advantage on saving throws against spells.

### Mirthful Leaps

Whenever you make a long jump or a high jump, you can roll a `d8` and add the number rolled to the number of feet you cover, even when making a standing jump. This extra distance costs movement as usual.

### Reveler

As an embodiment of revelry, you have proficiency in the [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance) and [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skills, and you have proficiency with one [musical instrument](/Systems/5e/items/musical-instrument.md) of your choice.

## Description

Originating in the Feywildâ€”a realm of pure emotion-satyrs thrive on the energy of merriment. They resemble elves but have goatlike legs, cloven hooves, and ram or goat horns. The magic of the fey realm has given them an innate ability to perform, to delight, and to resist magical intrusion. While they're usually found in the Feywild, satyrs do wander to other planes of existence, most often to the Material Plane. There they seek to bring a bit of their home plane's splendor to other worlds.
