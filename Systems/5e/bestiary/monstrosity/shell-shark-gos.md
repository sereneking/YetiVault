# Shell Shark
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 252*  

These impressive creatures, swimming through the sahuagin stronghold in The Final Enemy, are chosen by priestesses of Sekolah to serve as protectors and messengers. The sharks are blessed in a ritual during which plates of shell and coral are permanently affixed to their bodies.
