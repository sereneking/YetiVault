# Wonder Maker
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: [Gnome (Rock)](/Systems/5e/races/gnome-rock.md)

You master the tinker techniques of your people. You gain the following benefits:

- When you make a check using your proficiency with [tinker's tools](/Systems/5e/items/tinkers-tools.md), you add double your proficiency bonus to the check.  
- When you make a device with your Tinker trait, you have the following additional options for what you make:  
- **Alarm.** This device senses when a creature moves to within 15 feet of it without speaking aloud a password chosen when you create it. One round after a creature moves into range, the alarm makes a shrill ringing that lasts for 1 minute and can be heard from up to 300 feet away.  
- **Calculator.** This device makes doing sums easy.  
- **Lifter.** This device can be used as a [block and tackle](/Systems/5e/items/block-and-tackle.md), allowing its user to hoist five times the weight the user can normally lift.  
- **Timekeeper.** This pocket watch keeps accurate time.  
- **Weather Sensor.** When used as an action, this device predicts weather conditions in a 1-mile radius over the next 4 hours, showing one symbol (clouds, sun/moon, rain, or snow) for each hour.
