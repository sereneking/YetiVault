# Quavilithku Spyder-Fiend
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 236*  

Quavilithku spyder-fiends revel in destruction. Although they like to savage prey with their mangy wolf heads, they delight in destroying structures and art objectsâ€”the more beautiful, the better. The arms hanging below their wolf heads are physically frail but useful for employing tools of destruction or sabotage.

## Spyder-Fiends

Demonic beasts that combine the worst attributes of wolves and spiders, spyder-fiends scuttle about with bloated, spiderlike bodies and gnash with wolflike heads. Spyder-fiends are usually coated with gore, as brutal killing is their favorite pursuit. They spin durable webs and are ingenious in how they employ their webs against prey.

Spyder-fiends are organized into a hierarchy based on might and cunning, with higher-ranked spyder-fiends dominating lower ranks. Spyder-fiends of equivalent rank scheme against each other for advancement and eagerly turn against one another if treachery can improve their position.

Spyder-fiends loyally serve their general, Miska the Wolf-Spider. While they were rarely seen during Miska's imprisonment in Pandemonium, they have become increasingly active as Miska struggles to free himself in Pandesmos.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The quavilithku has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spider Climb.*** The quavilithku can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** When in contact with a web, the quavilithku knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The quavilithku ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The quavilithku makes two Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) piercing damage plus 17 (`5d6`) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature can't regain hit points. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Dissolving Web (Recharge 5-6).*** The quavilithku expels acid-drenched webs in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 (`8d10`) acid damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Nonmagical objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take 44 (`8d10`) acid damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Assess Weakness.*** The quavilithku sizes up a creature it can see within 40 feet of itself. Until the start of the quavilithku's next turn, it has advantage on attack rolls against the creature.
