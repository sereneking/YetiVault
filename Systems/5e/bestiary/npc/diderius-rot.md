## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Diderius has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Rejuvenation.*** A destroyed mummy lord gains a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of Diderius's heart.

***Spellcasting.*** Diderius is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, `+9` to hit with spell attacks). He has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md), [ray of frost](/Systems/5e/spells/ray-of-frost.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [shield](/Systems/5e/spells/shield.md), [thunderwave](/Systems/5e/spells/thunderwave.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [cloud of daggers](/Systems/5e/spells/cloud-of-daggers.md), [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [see invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/see-invisibility.md)

**3rd level (3 slots)**: [animate dead](/Systems/5e/spells/animate-dead.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mummy can use its Dreadful Glare and makes one attack with its rotting fist.

***Rotting Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`3d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (`3d6`) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.

***Dreadful Glare.*** Diderius targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see Diderius, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Diderius makes one attack with its rotting fist or uses its Dreadful Glare.

***Blinding Dust.*** Blinding dust and sand swirls magically around Diderius. Each creature within 5 feet of Diderius must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of the creature's next turn.

***Blasphemous Word (Costs 2 Actions).*** Diderius utters a blasphemous word. Each non-undead creature within 10 feet of Diderius that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of Diderius's next turn.

***Channel Negative Energy (Costs 2 Actions).*** Diderius magically unleashes negative energy. Creatures within 60 feet of Diderius, including ones behind barriers and around corners, can't regain hit points until the end of Diderius's next turn.

***Whirlwind of Sand (Costs 2 Actions).*** Diderius magically transforms into a whirlwind of sand, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, Diderius is immune to all damage, and it can't be [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled), [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified), knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), or [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned). Equipment worn or carried by Diderius remain in its possession.
