**Domain Theme**

|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Adversarial.** Adversarial personalities are common here, even among the local wildlife. Animated trees swat at passersby, sentient flowers scoff and sneer, and local Fey are grumpy and uncooperative. |
| 2 | **Crystalline.** This domain contains a profusion of crystal formations and outgrowths, as well as structures and trees made of crystal. Some of the crystals might generate light, music, or both. |
| 3 | **Gloomy.** Everything here has a gloomy cast. Tree branches look like skeletal fingers, night creatures slink and flutter about, and skull-like faces appear on plants, stones, and sprites' wings. |
| 4 | **Inquisitive.** Creatures in this domain are nosy and hungry for gossip. Animated trees use their branches to pick through backpacks when travelers aren't looking; pixies spy on strangers; and birds eavesdrop on conversations, repeating what they've heard to their masters. |
| 5 | **Kaleidoscopic.** This domain is a riot of everchanging colors. Plants come in a dazzling array of colors, flowers change color to suit the prevailing mood, and Fey wear costumes of scintillating hues. |
| 6 | **Lackadaisical.** The creatures here are easygoing. No one is in a hurry, and no task is greeted with a sense of urgency. |
| 7 | **Musical.** This domain abounds with music. Frogs, toads, and insects break into multipart harmonies that sometimes crescendo into a symphonic rapture of melodious tweets, trills, chirps, and whistles. Fey in this domain are just as musically inclined. |
| 8 | **Poisonous.** Almost every plant here has spines or thorns that cause anything from itchy welts to damage or out-of-body experiences. Other sources of poison might be present as well (for example, toxic bogs or giant, poisonous Beasts). |
