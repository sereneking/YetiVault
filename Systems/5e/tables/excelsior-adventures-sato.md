| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | An [androsphinx](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/androsphinx.md) arrives in Excelsior and declares itself the new high chancellor. Forough petitions the characters to help cement her authority. |
| 2 | The [empyrean](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md) Tygrant receives a prophecy that he can return to Mount Celestia only if he is humbled through defeat. He challenges all of Excelsior, including the characters, to wrestling matches in his tower. |
| 3 | Allowed into the "forum" on an ancient contract, a silver-tongued [pit fiend](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) invites Excelsior's orators to debate the worth of a soul. An angel asks the characters to take the podium. |
| 4 | The faith of a divine champion ([gladiator](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/gladiator.md)) begins to waver in the "Chandelier", causing their cloud keep to shudder. A [lantern archon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/lantern-archon-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") asks the characters to erase the warrior's doubt before their fortress falls from the sky. |
