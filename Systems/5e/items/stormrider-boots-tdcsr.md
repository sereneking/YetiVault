# Stormrider Boots
*Wondrous Item, rare*  


These dark leather boots look to be of common make, but a subtle pattern of swirling storm clouds upon their soles suggests the potency of their enchantment. You can activate these boots as part of your movement, gaining the following benefits until the end of your turn:

- You have a flying speed of 90 feet.  
- [Opportunity attacks](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20attack) against you are made with disadvantage.  
- Whenever you move within 5 feet of a hostile creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take `3d8` lightning damage. A creature can't be damaged in this way more than once per turn.  

Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
