# Yeenoghu
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 270, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 155*  

The Beast of Butchery appears as a great scarred gnoll, towering 14 feet tall. Yeenoghu is the Gnoll Lord, and his creations are made in his twisted image. When the demon lord hunted across the Material Plane, packs of hyenas followed in his wake, and those that ate of great Yeenoghu's kills became gnolls. Few others worship the Beast of Butchery, but those who do tend to take on a gnoll-like aspect, hunching over and filing their teeth down to points.

Yeenoghu wants nothing more than slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his favorite instruments, and he drives his gnoll followers to ever-greater atrocities in his name, even imbuing some of their commanders with his powers, which transforms them into flinds (in this book). Yeenoghu takes pleasure in causing fear before death, and he sows sorrow and despair through destroying beloved things. He doesn't parlay; to meet him is to do battle with himâ€”unless he becomes bored and wanders away. The Beast of Butchery has a long rivalry with Baphomet, the Horned King, and the two demon lords and their followers attack one another on sight.

The Gnoll Lord is covered in matted fur and leathery hide, and his face resembles a grinning predator's skull. He wields a triple-headed flail called the Butcher, which he can summon into his hand at will, although he is as likely to tear his prey apart with his teeth.

## Yeenoghu's Lair

Yeenoghu's lair in the Abyss is called the Death Dells. Its barren hills and ravines serve as a hunting ground, where he pursues captured mortals in a cruel game. Yeenoghu's lair is a place of blood and death, populated by [gnolls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/gnoll.md), [hyenas](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/hyena.md), and [ghouls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md), and there are few structures or signs of civilization on his layer of the Abyss.

The challenge rating of Yeenoghu is 25 (75,000 XP) when he's encountered in his lair.
