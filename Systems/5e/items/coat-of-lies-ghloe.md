# Coat of Lies
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


This coat made of the severed tongues of a [harvester](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/harvester-of-lies-ghloe.md)'s victims provides a +1 bonus to your AC, and you have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) checks.

Additionally, as a bonus action three times per day, you can activate the magic of the cloak. If you do, the next spell you cast before the start of your next turn can be cast without any somatic or verbal components.
