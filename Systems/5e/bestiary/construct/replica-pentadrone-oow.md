## Traits

***Axiomatic Mind.*** The pentadrone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

***Dismantlable.*** If the replica pentadrone dies, its body falls into a pile of parts (gears, plates, screws, and wires), leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The pentadrone makes five arm attacks.

***Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Paralysis Gas (Recharge 5-6).*** The pentadrone exhales a 30-foot cone of gas. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
