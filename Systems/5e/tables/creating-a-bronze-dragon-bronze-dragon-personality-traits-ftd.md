**Bronze Dragon Personality Traits**

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | The weakest creatures sometimes display the greatest courage. I respect all beings who risk their lives in defense of something greater than themselves. |
| 2 | My payment is a matter of principle. Requiring even a small fee for my service allows those I help to preserve their dignity. It's really for your benefit. |
| 3 | I have no time for chitchat or insinuation. I get to the point and expect others to do the same. |
| 4 | I respect law and order, but it's no excuse for tyranny. Those who abuse power must be stripped of it, and soldiers have a responsibility to refuse immoral orders. |
| 5 | I strive to treat foes honorably, but not at the expense of strategy. A quick death in combat is its own kind of courtesy. |
| 6 | I trust my gut. I'd rather act on incomplete information than be hamstrung by indecision. |
| 7 | I'm fascinated by other species' military technology, especially magic armaments and siege enginesâ€”the bigger, the better! |
| 8 | Conflict drives evolution. By sparking wars between nations, I contribute to the advancement of their civilizations. (And they pay me for it, too!) |
