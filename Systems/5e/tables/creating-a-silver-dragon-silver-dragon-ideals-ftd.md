| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Sensualism. I savor the world and consume its myriad delights with appropriate gratitude. (Any) |
| 2 | Altruism. We are surrounded by a malignant and unfeeling cosmos. Ultimately, all we have is each other. (Good) |
| 3 | Camaraderie. The true treasure is the friends we make along the way. (Good) |
| 4 | Leadership. These younger species will do great things—but need some subtle support. (Good) |
| 5 | Guile. All the world is a stage, and it is both my purpose and my pleasure to give an excellent performance. (Any) |
| 6 | Ownership. This town, these families, this world—I've spent centuries watching over them, and they belong to me. (Evil) |
