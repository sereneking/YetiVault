| 1 | A [guardian naga](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/guardian-naga.md) and a [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) each defend half of an artifact called the Sundered Crown. |
| 2 | A [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) and a [medusa](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/medusa.md) have been enemies for so long that they've developed mutual respect, communicating by way of a magical book that teleports back and forth between them. |
| 3 | A [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) seeks to turn a band of [cyclopes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) into a disciplined army, with little success. |
| 4 | A [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) has been magically bound to the service of a [marid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/marid.md), and the dragon is unable to take direct action to get free of the genie. |
| 5 | A [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) runs a prestigious military academy, training paladins of smaller species to fight for justice beneath the dragon's banner. |
| 6 | Dragonborn pirates bribe a [young bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/young-bronze-dragon.md) into helping them steal ship cargoes for a sizable cut of the profits. |
