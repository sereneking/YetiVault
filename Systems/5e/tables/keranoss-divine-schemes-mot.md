**Keranos's Divine Schemes**

| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Bored with the temporary beauty of violent weather, Keranos creates a massive, self-perpetuating storm. Over time, the storm grows out of control. Keranos is delighted by his creation. |
| 2 | Dared by Phenax to prove that he can, Keranos inspires eight mortals with eight ingenious ways to destroy the world. As a result, a genius actor, alchemist, inventor, diver, miner, sculptor, thief, and a duplicitous goat all set forth to enact their terrible brilliance. |
| 3 | Keranos finds the spread of mortal knowledge inconsistent and slow. He empowers a champion to grant vast knowledge to any person or beast she touches. The advent of sagacious cattle, wolves, and children greatly disrupts (and unnerves) those who live in the areas through which Keranos's champion travels. |
| 4 | Keranos creates a realm of his own design amid the Dakra Isles, a place where the land and its creatures obey unique physical laws and strange truths. Some of the inhabitants escape the isle and begin infecting the rest of Theros with their alternate reality. |
