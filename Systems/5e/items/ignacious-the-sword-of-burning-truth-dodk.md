# Ignacious, the Sword of Burning Truth
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 S

This sacred weapon was forged to burn away deception and darkness. Blazing embers gently fall from the silver blade, first ignited by the brazier in the Temple of Lumen.

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties:

You can use a bonus action to speak the sword's name, causing radiant flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra `4d6` radiant damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to douse the blade, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

## Sentience

Ignacious is a sentient lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 11, a Wisdom of 19, and a Charisma of 23. It has hearing and [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, Celestial, and Draconic, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. It always knows its wielder's thoughts. Its voice is commanding, righteous, and booming. When drawn, Ignacious casts the [zone of truth](/Systems/5e/spells/zone-of-truth.md) spell (save DC 20), and maintains [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on it so that you don't have to. The [zone of truth](/Systems/5e/spells/zone-of-truth.md) moves with the blade and remains centred on it.

## Personality

Ignacious is zealously devoted to the Sacred Flame, and has memorized every word of its holy texts. The blade wishes to be wielded by a faithful devotee of any sort; Ignacious does not care about the religious divide between the Falling Fire and the Sacred Flame so long as its wielder keeps the core tenets shared by both sects.

The sword's purpose is to expose all deception and reveal the truth. It does not tolerate any falsehood, duplicitousness, or lies. The sword always knows when it hears a lie, and responds with wrathful fury. If a wielder speaks a lie, it immediately triggers a conflict.

## Relics of Saint Vitruvio

These holy relics of the Sacred Flame were wielded by Saint Vitruvio and are kept in several religious sites throughout Drakkenheim. The Knights of the Silver Order and the Followers of the Falling Fire now seek these relics. Not only do both factions revere Saint Vitruvio, both wish to use these relics to help advance their goals in Drakkenheim.

A character attuned to three Relics of Saint Vitruvio may cast the [heal](/Systems/5e/spells/heal.md) spell three times per day, after which they must finish a long rest before they may do so again. In addition, that character gains the ability to attune to two additional magic items so long as those magic items are both Relics of Saint Vitruvio.
