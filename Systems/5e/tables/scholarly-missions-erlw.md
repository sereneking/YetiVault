**Scholarly Missions**

`dice: [](scholarly-missions-erlw.md#^scholarly-missions)`

| dice: d6 | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Adventurous Archeology**. Your focus is on finding ancient artifacts and bringing back what you can. |
| 2 | **Arcane Research**. Your team focuses on acquiring magical knowledge that can only be found outside the university walls. |
| 3 | **Investigative Ecology**. None can say how many amazing creatures make their homes in the world's wildest reaches, but you're dedicated to finding out. |
| 4 | **Historical Research**. Your team's work involves learning more about Eberron's long history. |
| 5 | **Radical Engineering**. The birth of a new race wasn't the peak of magical and mechanical engineering, it was just the beginning of new scientific fields you now explore. |
| 6 | **Exploration**. Khorvaire is a vast continent, and areas beyond the heartland of the Five Nations are poorly charted. Your focus is on understanding the wilder places of the world, as well as distant cultures. |
