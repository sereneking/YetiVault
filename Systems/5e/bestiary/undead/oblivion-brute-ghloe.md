# Oblivion Brute

## Salvage

There is a 25% chance that an oblivion stalker leaves behind a gemstone when it is defeated. These stones are worth between 10 and 500 gp, depending on the size of the creature. There is a 10% chance that one of these stones acts as a magnet to additional oblivion stalkers, which appear and attack the holder of the gem at midnight during a new moon. A remove curse makes the gemstone safe.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** An oblivion stalker is at disadvantage in daylight.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** An oblivion stalker is vulnerable to radiant damage and resistant to nonmagical weapons.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** If an oblivion stalker kills a mortal, it's believed that mortal joins their shadowy ranks.  

> [!note] Customizing Oblivion Stalkers
> 
> Since oblivion stalkers can drain almost any living creature's energy, they can take just about any form. Some oblivion stalkers retain the natural abilities of their original form. For instance, an oblivion stalker that was once a wolf might retain the Pack Tactics trait. Similarly, a boar could possess a version of Charge, draining its prey while adding slashing damage and the possibility of knocking their victim prone.
> 
> Keep one special ability that makes sense for a creature of the stalker's former form without affecting the Challenge of the stalker. Avoid bestowing an oblivion stalker any ability that is magical, grants the stalker a ranged attack, or expands its resistances or immunities.

## Traits

***Shadow Stealth.*** While in dim light or darkness, the oblivion brute can take the Hide action as a bonus action.

***Sunlight Weakness.*** While in sunlight, the oblivion brute has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

## Actions

***Soul Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (`3d8 + 3`) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target's available Hit Dice are reduced by 1. If this effect reduces the target's Hit Dice to 0, the target falls [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious). The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining consciousness on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return at the end of a short rest, in time to spend them to regain hit points.

If an oblivion brute kills a living creature with this attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target's soul is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised from the dead only with mighty magic, such as wish or divine intervention.

***Unbearable Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The oblivion brute emits a howl in a 30-foot cone. Each creature that isn't [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened) or undead in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. While [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) this way, a creature's speed is halved. A [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any oblivion brute's Unbearable Howl for the next 24 hours.
