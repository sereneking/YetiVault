**Red Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-red-dragon-red-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^red-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Cruelty. Pain and fear are the most powerful tools. With them, any creature's will can be broken. (Evil) |
| 2 | Might. Only the strongest survive and prosper, so I must be the strongest of all. (Any) |
| 3 | Greed. If I desire a thing, then it must be mine and mine alone. (Evil) |
| 4 | Respect. All that I have achieved must be acknowledged and treated with the utmost respect. (Any) |
| 5 | No Limits. I do whatever I please, whenever it pleases me to do so. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | Responsibility. Fire destroys, but it can also temper when it is applied carefullyâ€”if the material tested is strong enough. (Lawful) |
