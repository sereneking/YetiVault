# Ringlerun
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 227*  

Ringlerun became an adventurer to better satisfy his craving for arcane knowledge. One of his adventures took him into an underwater tomb, where he tricked a marid into surrendering a staff of power. This staff greatly increased Ringlerun's capabilities and made him the envy of many rival spellcasters.

Ringlerun has a good heart, but he's easily distracted by intellectual pursuits. He would rather spend time in quiet contemplation or reading than in frivolous conversation.

If its last charge is expended, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses its other properties; on a 20, it regains `1d8 + 2` charges.

***Spellcasting.*** Ringlerun casts one of the following spells, using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At will**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md)
