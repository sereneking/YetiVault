# Fate Eater
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 168*  

*Violet radiance surrounds this large pale centipede. Its flesh is translucent, and its jaws are crystalline.*

## Destiny Destroyers

Fate eaters infest remote areas of the planes, where they consume the threads of Fate itself. The beings in charge of Fate view them as vermin. Sometimes those beings engage particularly canny planar travelers either to hunt fate eaters or to help repair the damage they've done. This can be a deadly job, as the fate eaters consider the destiny of a mortal to be the tastiest of delicacies, rich in savory possibilities.

## Planar Gossips

Fate eaters can and do trade information about various dooms, fates, and outcomes, but one must have something rich in destiny to tradeâ€”or at least, juicy gossip about gods and demons.

## Visionary Flesh

Eating the properly prepared flesh of a fate eater grants the eater insight into the fate of another being.

## Traits

***Visionary Flesh.*** A creature that eats the flesh of a fate eater must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. On a success, the creature gains the benefits of the divination spell.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The fate eater makes two Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) slashing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage.

***Alter Fate (Recharge 5-6).*** The fate eater alters the fate of one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 36 (`8d8`) psychic damage, and its fate is altered. Roll a `d6` to determine which of the following alterations affects the creature. On a success, the creature takes half the damage, and its fate isn't altered. A creature with an altered fate for 1 minute or less can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, a creature with an altered fate can repeat the saving throw at the end of each long rest, ending the effect on itself on a success.
