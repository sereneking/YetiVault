# Giant Snail
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 234*  

These large mollusks retreat into their hardy shells when threatened, and they're particularly susceptible to being injured by contact with salt.

## Traits

***Salt Osmosis.*** Whenever the snail starts its turn in contact with a pound or more of salt, it takes `1d4` necrotic damage. Using an action to sprinkle a pound of salt on the snail deals `1d4` necrotic damage to it immediately and another `1d4` necrotic damage to it at the start of its next turn (after which the salt rubs off), provided the snail has not withdrawn into its shell.

## Actions

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Shell Defense.*** The snail withdraws into its shell, gaining a +4 bonus to its AC until it emerges. It can emerge from its shell as a bonus action on its turn.
