*Source: Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary* 

**Mortuary Encounters (Levels 5—10)**

`dice: [](mortuary-encounters-levels-510-aatm.md#^mortuary-encounters-levels-510)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | Three [ghosts](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of long-dead nobles invite the characters to an incorporeal tea party. |
| 2 | `1d8 + 3` [ghouls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghoul.md) feast on a veritable smorgasbord of corpses in a chilly morgue. The ghouls attack any who disturb their meal. |
| 3 | Twenty [skeletons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) parade down a dusty hall, dancing all the way. The skeletons are friendly toward characters who join their procession but attack any who impede it. |
| 4 | Disguised as a Humanoid member of the Heralds of Dust, a [planetar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) sneaks through a crypt in hopes of raising one of its god's agents from the dead. The angel reveals itself to the characters and asks for help in finding its way. |
| 5 | The party unknowingly enters a crematorium, and the walls erupt with gouts of flame. Each creature in the room must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 (`8d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
| 6 | A [stone golem](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/stone-golem.md) composed of tombstones tromps down an empty hallway. It lets the characters pass if they etch an epitaph into its frame. |
| 7 | A passing [animated coffin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-coffin-aatm.md)* exhales a hostile cloud of [vampiric mist](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/vampiric-mist-mpmm.md)† with an audible wheeze. |
| 8 | `1d6 + 2` [vargouilles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/vargouille-mpmm.md)† fly through the halls, looking for their next meal. The vargouilles attack the characters on sight. |
| 9 | `1d4` [spawns of Kyuss](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/spawn-of-kyuss-mpmm.md)† shamble through the Mortuary, infecting its corpses. A lawful neutral [wight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/wight.md) shouts for the party's aid in curbing the infestation. |
| 10 | Two [lost sorrowsworn](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/lost-sorrowsworn-mpmm.md),† manifestations of those who never reached the afterlife, wander aimlessly. The sorrowsworn ask the characters to guide them to the great beyond. If the characters refuse the sorrowsworn attack in panicked fury. |
