# Magic Tattoos
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Spells and Magic Tattoos p. 8* 

Blending magic and artistry with ink and needles, magic tattoos imbue their bearers with wondrous effects and abilities. Magic tattoos are initially bound to magic needles, which transfer their magic to a creature. The designs of magic tattoos vary greatly in appearance depending on who created it, but they share general characteristics that hint at the effect of the tattoo.

Once inscribed on a creature's skin, damage or injury doesn't impair the tattoo's function, even if the tattoo is defaced.

The rarer a magic tattoo is, the more space it occupies on a creature's skin. The Magic Tattoo Coverage table offers guidelines for how large a given tattoo is.

**Magic Tattoo Coverage**

| Tattoo Rarity | Area Covered |
|---------------|--------------|
| Common | Up to 6 inches |
| Uncommon | Half a limb or the scalp |
| Rare | One limb |
| Very Rare | Two limbs or the chest or upper back |
| Legendary | Two limbs and the torso |

> [!note] Variant: Body Modification
> 
> These items needn't be limited to just tattoos. They can instead be presented as other body modifications such as brands, scarification, birthmarks, patterns of scales, or any other cosmetic skin adornment or alteration. Consider the object a magical body modification is bound to instead of tattoo needles, such as branding irons or enchanted dragon scales.
