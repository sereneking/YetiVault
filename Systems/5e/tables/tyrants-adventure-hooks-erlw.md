|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A friendly NPC dies in combat. The corpse reveals its true form to be that of a changeling. |
| 2 | A list of Tyrants agents and their identities exists somewhere in Sharn. Every legitimate and criminal organization in the city competes to find it. |
| 3 | The *Sharn Inquisitive* publishes an anonymous article accusing several members of the Sharn Watch, the city council, and the dragonmarked houses of being changeling members of the Tyrants. The accused individuals vehemently deny the claims. |
| 4 | A shamed Brelish general of the Last War goes on a killing spree against changelings, claiming the Tyrants ruined his life by exposing his extramarital affair. |
| 5 | A Sharn Watch captain being blackmailed by the Tyrants has had enough. He publicly exposes his incriminating secrets, then offers a reward for information concerning the organization. |
| 6 | Roll on another organization's Adventure Hooks table; the Tyrants are secretly involved in the situation. |
