*Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount p. 151* 

`dice: [](uncanny-phenomena-egw.md#^phenomenon)`

| dice: d10 | Phenomenon |
|-----------|------------|
| 1 | It smells of death here. This area is permanently ridden with the stench of rot and decay. |
| 2 | Incorporeal phantoms move in and out of reality here. These apparitions ignore any interaction with creatures. |
| 3 | Everything is a single color here. All physical matter in this area adopts the pigmentation of one of the seven colors of the rainbow or the color black. |
| 4 | Nonmagical fire can't burn here. |
| 5 | Sources of light here appear kaleidoscopic. Empty air refracts light in this area, creating dazzling displays of prismatic colors. |
| 6 | Any character who sleeps here dreams of a different life on a different world in a different body. |
| 7 | There is no sound here. This area is permanently under the effects of the [silence](/Systems/5e/spells/silence.md) spell. |
| 8 | This place is supernaturally unlucky. Attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws cannot be rerolled in this area. |
| 9 | Water turns to acid here. Water introduced to this area becomes acid in `1d4` days. |
| 10 | This place is haunted by fragments of the Far Realm. Whenever the target of a Wisdom saving throw fails its save, that creature has a 5% chance chance of becoming afflicted by a random form of long-term madness (see ""Madness"" in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). |
