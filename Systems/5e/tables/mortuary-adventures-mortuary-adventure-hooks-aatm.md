| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A wrongfully interred [death knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) launches a campaign against Factol Skall, fomenting dissent and dividing the Heralds of Dust into splinter factions. Factol Skall hires the characters to unite the dead before the faction crumbles beyond repair. |
| 2 | A multiversal law dictates that a death council must convene in the Mortuary once every century. The characters are charged with exhuming a series of influential Undead entombed on other planes and escorting them to the Mortuary. Some of the council members are especially cranky when awoken. |
| 3 | When a godling is born on the Upper Planes, a wave of positive energy sweeps over the Mortuary through its myriad portals, restoring hundreds of long-dead creatures to life. |
| 4 | [Factol Skall](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/factol-skall-aatm.md) (see the appendix) announces his retirement. Before he transcends to True Death, he asks the characters to help him name his successor. |
