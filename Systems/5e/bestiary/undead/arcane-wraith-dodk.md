# Arcane Wraith
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 197*  

Many spellcasters who died in Drakkenheim have become disembodied and corrupt undead spirits, still flowing with arcane power but twisted into evil, shadowy forms. They drift through the ruins, hungering for magical essence as much as living life force.

## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The wraith can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the wraith has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Spellcasting.*** The wraith is an 8th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, `+5` to hit with spell attacks). The wraith knows the following sorcerer spells:

**At will**: [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [magic missile](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-missile.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1/day**: [hypnotic pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md)

**3/day**: [lightning bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/lightning-bolt.md)

## Actions

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 (`4d8 + 3`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Create Specter.*** The wraith targets a humanoid within 10 feet of it that has been dead for no longer than 1 minute and died violently. The target's spirit rises as a [specter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The [specter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) is under the wraith's control. The wraith can have no more than seven specters under its control at one time.
