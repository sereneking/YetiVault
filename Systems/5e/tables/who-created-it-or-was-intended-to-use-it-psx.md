| dice: d12 | Origin or Intended User |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| 1–2 | **Sun Empire**. The item was created during the heyday of the Sun Empire, most likely during the time that the Immortal Sun was housed in the imperial capital of Orazca. It might be tied to a former emperor or an emperor's champion. It might be decorated with imagery of the Immortal Sun, as well as geometric patterns, feather designs, or dinosaur shapes. It might be made of silver or incorporate amber. |
| 3 | **Dinosaur**. This item is made from scales, teeth, talons, or feathers shed by a dinosaur. |
| 4–5 | **River Heralds**. The item is probably crafted from jade or polished wood. It might include designs resembling knots or braids. If fabric, it appears to be knotted or braided out of long strips. Weapons often have a wave-like curve to their design. The item could have an elemental spirit bound into it. |
| 6–7 | **Brazen Coalition**. The item was devised by the crafty inventors of the Brazen Coalition. It might incorporate designs like ship fittings or knotted rope into its construction, or it could feature polished wood, carefully focused lenses, or fabric that billows like sails. |
| 8–9 | **Legion of Dusk**. The item might be fashioned of bone, gold, or ancient-looking black wood. It might have a two-pronged motif or incorporate the rose-like symbol of the Legion. |
| 10 | **Coatl**. The item is half the weight of other items of its kind, and is inscribed with feathered wings, serpents, suns, and other symbols of good. Demons find the item's presence repulsive. |
| 11 | **Demonic**. The item is made of black iron or horn inscribed with runes, and any cloth or leather components are crafted from the hide of demons. It might incorporate the feathers, claws, or beaks of harpies. It is warm to the touch and features leering faces or vile runes engraved on its surface. Coatls find the item's presence repulsive. |
| 12 | **Dryad**. The item is exquisitely crafted from wood, leaves, or vines. It is adorned with symbols of nature: leaves, vines, stars, and the like. It glows with a pale radiance in moonlight, shedding dim light in a 5-foot radius. |
