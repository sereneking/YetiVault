# Mind Flayer Prophet
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 210*  

Some mind flayers dedicate their lives to channeling abstruse truths from beyond reality. This insight gives them preternatural senses and allows them to focus their innate psionic power.

## Mind Flayers

Mind flayers, also known as illithids, feast on the brains of Humanoids across the multiverse. They are distinguished by their purple-toned skin and octopus-like heads, from which extend writhing tentacles.

## Traits

***Awareness.*** The mind flayer has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised as long as it doesn't have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition.

***Magic Resistance.*** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The mind flayer casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md)

**1/day each**: [dominate monster](/Systems/5e/spells/dominate-monster.md), [plane shift](/Systems/5e/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only), [true seeing](/Systems/5e/spells/true-seeing.md)

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 16) and must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or have the [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition until the grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one Humanoid [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the mind flayer. *Hit:* 55 (`10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills it by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Whip (Recharge 5-6).*** The mind flayer lashes out with psychic energy, targeting up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw or take 23 (`4d8 + 5`) psychic damage and have the [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) condition for 1 minute. A [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
