# Hardened Delerium-tipped Arrows
*Generic Variant, rare*  


This piece of ammunition has a refined delerium arrowtip. A creature hit by a ranged attack using one of these arrows takes an extra (`3d6`) necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination. Once it hits a target, the delerium tip crumbles to dust and the arrow becomes nonmagical.
