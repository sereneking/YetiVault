# Moonlit King

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Moonlit King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Moonlit King can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Frightful Whispers.** Disembodied whispers speaking of despair and failure erupt from a point the Moonlit King can see within 120 feet of him. Each non-Fiend creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.  
- **Maddening Hallucinations.** Shadows and moonlight dance around up to three creatures the Moonlit King can see within 60 feet of him. Each target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn as hallucinations fill its mind. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target suffers short-term madness.  
- **Moonlit Illumination.** Four beams of moonlight appear on points the Moonlit King can see within 120 feet of him. Each beam sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius centered on a point. The moon beams last until the Moonlit King uses this lair action again or until he dies.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the Moonlit King's lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Constant Moonlight.** Weather conditions don't inhibit moonlight shining within 10 miles of the lairâ€”clouds part, rain seems to channel moonbeams, and snow takes on a luminous silver glow.  
- **Stryx Network.** The area within 5 miles of the Moonlit King's lair attracts hundreds of stryxes and owls. The King can choose to see or hear through the senses of any stryx or owl in this area.  
- **Waking Dreams.** Dreams and fears take on a life of their own. Minor visual and auditory hallucinations plague creatures within 3 miles of the lair.  

If the Moonlit King dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
