# Alternative Resurrection Rules: Harrowing Return
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 213* 

Character death often becomes no more than a minor inconvenience in some campaigns. Once an adventuring party reaches a certain level, the spells available to return fallen comrades from the afterlife—including [revivify](/Systems/5e/spells/revivify.md), [raise dead](/Systems/5e/spells/raise-dead.md), and [resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/resurrection.md)—make death no more than a temporary setback, potentially undermining one of the most significant elements of danger and threat in the campaign story. For players and GMs who wish to elevate the gravity of character death, the optional rules in this section offer three different approaches.

## Harrowing Return

In games that use this house rule, the process of a character dying and being pulled back into their body becomes a traumatic experience. The magic that pulls the spirit from beyond the dark veil of death takes a toll on that spirit each time, changing a person in unexpected and profound ways.

This rule is best for campaigns with dark and horrific themes. It adds a dose of grim bleakness that might not feel at home in epic and heroic stories. Players and GMs who want to make use of this rule "should talk about it beforehand", and if any player says no or doesn't offer enthusiastic support, it's best to not use it. It's also important for GMs to check in with the players whenever this rule comes into play, just to make sure everyone is still having fun with the darker themes.

When a character is brought back to life by any spell other than [true resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/true-resurrection.md), that character must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 22 − the level of the spell used to return the character to life. On a failure, the character's experience of death and the afterlife exacts a heavy toll, determined by rolling on the [Harrowing Return](/Systems/5e/tables/harrowing-return-tdcsr.md) table. The consequence lasts until the GM rules that the character has resolved it. Consequences with no clear resolution last for `1d10 × 10` days, after which the player decides how their character overcame it. Or, to make a campaign even darker, the players and the GM can agree that these consequences last indefinitely.

Alternatively, rather than rolling on the table, a player and a GM can work together to choose a consequence that creates an interesting story for the character. Such a consequence might tie to the character's backstory, the themes of the campaign, or the circumstances under which the character died.

A [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell temporarily suppresses a consequence of being brought back from the dead, but the consequence returns each time the character drops to 0 hit points or finishes a long rest, until the consequence is resolved.

> O lady of cold winters and the long night of all souls. O harbinger of all ends and eternal sentinel of the final threshold. I entreat you—nay, I beseech you! You bear within your grasp the soul of one whose fate has not yet reached its end. Bear witness, O queen of night-black feathers; turn your divine gaze to the golden bonds that tie the living to the departed.

A portrait painted by a mother, of an infant, untouched by the sorrows of the world. O Matron of Death, I plead to you—hear their cries! Let not this warrior's fate end here.
