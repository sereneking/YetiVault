# Lord of the Hunt

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Lord of the Hunt takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Lord of the Hunt can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Cry Havoc.** The Wild Hunt echoes with an otherworldly war cry. One creature the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Encourage Undergrowth.** Plants erupt from a point on the ground the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him. The area within 20 feet of that point is difficult terrain. A creature that enters the difficult terrain for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (`2d8`) poison damage and be restrained by vines. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 19 Strength check. The plants remain until the Lord of the Hunt uses this lair action again or until he dies.  
- **Mark Prey.** One creature the Lord of the Hunt can see within 120 feet of him must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be magically marked until initiative count 20 on the next round. The Lord has advantage on attack rolls against the marked target.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the Lord of the Hunt's encampment is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Game Preserve.** Game animals become plentiful within 3 miles of the lair. Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks to hunt for food are made with advantage, but patrols from the Wild Hunt don't take kindly to poachers.  
- **Hunting Grounds.** Areas of natural terrain within 3 miles of the lair subtly rearrange themselves to create game trails through even the densest wilderness.  
- **Spooked Animals.** Domesticated animals within 3 miles of the lair become skittish and fearful. They are more difficult to handle and flee the area if left to their own devices.  

When the Lord of the Hunt breaks camp or dies, these effects end immediately.
