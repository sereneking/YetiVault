# Garmyr
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 197*  

Once thought to be related to gnolls, garmyr are bipedal canids unique to the Haze-ridden ruins of Drakkenheim. Often covered in thick fur, their colouration and features vary from hound-like to wolf-like, but all bear sharp teeth and claws. They form hyper-aggressive and predatory warpacks equipped with weapons taken from the many failed military attempts to reclaim the city. These beasts revel in their countless battles with adventurers and the Hooded Lanterns. The garmyr warpacks have made the Inner City their hunting ground, but have been sighted roving the countryside with increasing frequency. They live for the thrill of the hunt, and mock and taunt their prey as they chase them down. Though the warpacks are prone to infighting, a massive beast known as the [Lord of the Feast](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/lord-of-the-feast-dodk.md) rules the garmyr as their overlord, master, and god.
