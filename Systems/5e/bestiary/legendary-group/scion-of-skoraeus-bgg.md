# Scion of Skoraeus

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Skoraeus is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Abundant Stone and Minerals.** Smooth stones and gems grow within 6 miles of the scion.  
- **Edible Moss.** Carpets of golden moss that stone giants find tasty grow on cavern walls within 6 miles of the scion.  
- **Empowered Stone Giants.** Stone giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +7 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  

If the scion dies, the Empowered Stone Giants effect ends immediately. The other effects cease to produce new moss and minerals, and existing moss dies within `1d10` days.
