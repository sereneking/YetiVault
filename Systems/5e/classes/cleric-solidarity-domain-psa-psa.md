# Solidarity Domain (PSA)
*[Cleric](cleric.md): Divine Domain*  
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 24*  


## Class Features

### Solidarity Domain (PSA) (Level 1)

> The worthy must know and respect all others whom the God-Pharaoh deems worthy, for in the afterlife, all will be united in purpose and action.

Oketra is charged with expounding upon this teaching of the God-Pharaoh, instilling in every initiate the virtue of solidarity. She forges each group of children into a crop of acolytes with just one purpose: to be judged worthy of a glorious afterlife. And she instills in each crop the ability to unite in a single action in pursuit of that purpose. She is fond of poetic imagery to communicate her ideals.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared.

### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.

### Solidarity's Action (Level 1)

Also at 1st level, when you take the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action to aid an ally's attack, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Preserve Life (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to heal the badly injured.

As an action, you present your holy symbol and evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half of its hit point maximum. You can't use this feature on an undead or a construct.

### Oketra's Blessing (Level 6)

At 6th level, when a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll, you can use your reaction to grant that creature a +10 bonus to the roll, using your Channel Divinity. You make this choice after you see the roll, but before the DM says whether the attack hits or misses.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `1d8` damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to `2d8`.

### Blessed Strikes (Level 8)

*8th-level cleric [optional class features](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/optional-class-features-tce.md), which replaces the Divine Strike feature*

You are blessed with divine might in battle. When a creature takes damage from one of your cantrips or weapon attacks, you can also deal `1d8` radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

### Supreme Healing (Level 17)

Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring `2d6` hit points to a creature, you restore 12.
