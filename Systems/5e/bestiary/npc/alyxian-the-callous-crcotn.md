## Traits

***Apotheonic Rejuvenation.*** When Alyxian the Callous drops to 0 hit points, his body dies and sheds its wings, and he rises to his feet in his third form, Alyxian the Dispossessed. His initiative count doesn't change.

***Divinely Blessed.*** Alyxian can't be [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) and can't be changed into another form against his will.

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If Alyxian fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Alyxian makes two Radiant Spear attacks. He can replace one of these attacks with Blinding Teleport.

***Radiant Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) radiant damage.

***Blinding Teleport.*** Alyxian teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space he can see within 120 feet of himself. Each creature within 5 feet of his new location must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of its next turn.

***Heavenly Destruction (1/Day).*** Alyxian releases divine energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature of his choice in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed saving throw, the creature takes 31 (`7d8`) radiant damage and is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Alyxian makes one Radiant Spear attack.

***Celestial Chains.*** Alyxian targets one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by magical chains for 1 minute. While [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) in this way, the target can't leave the space by any means. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Flare (Costs 2 Actions).*** Alyxian targets one creature he can see within 30 feet of himself. Light flares around the target, dealing 17 (`5d6`) radiant damage to it and creatures within 10 feet of it.
