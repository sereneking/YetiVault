> Many weapons created by mortals during the Age of Arcanum were designed with hopes to surpass or even destroy the gods, but not so with Dwueth'var. That shining sword, bright with the light of the bold full moon and the enigmatic starlit night, was forged by acolytes of the Wildmother and the Moonweaver, united in their love of this fragile world and their determination to protect it.

The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver [longsword](/Systems/5e/items/longsword.md) is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the "Calamity", but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in "Wildemount".
