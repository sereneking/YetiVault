| 1 | A cloud giant seeks to gain wealth by investing in an adventuring party (perhaps giving the characters magic items or other valuables) in exchange for a share of the party's rewards. |
| 2 | A cloud giant hosts an art gala in a cloud castle to display their wealth, providing an opportunity for the characters to retrieve an important magic item from the giant's collection. |

| 5 | A cloud giant who recently lost a large amount of money on bad bets tries to recoup those losses by plundering a royal treasury or the adventurers' stronghold. |
