A momentary bubble of iridescent energy shimmers in the air between you and the caster of the triggering spell. The spell is redirected to a creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet. If the spell is 5th level or lower, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. If the spell is 6th level or higher, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check, you are no longer a target of the spell and the chosen creature is instead. On a failed check, you remain the target of the triggering spell.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md)
