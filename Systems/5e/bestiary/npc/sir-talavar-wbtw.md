# Sir Talavar
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 69*  

Sir Talavar is an esteemed member of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. Many of Sir Talavar's squires have gone on to become knights of great renown. The venerable faerie dragon has an encouraging, can-do demeanor and an unwavering sense of honor.

## Traits

***Superior Invisibility.*** As a bonus action, Sir Talavar can magically turn [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until his [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment Sir Talavar wears or carries is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with him.

***Limited Telepathy.*** Using telepathy, Sir Talavar can magically communicate with any other faerie dragon within 60 feet of him.

***Magic Resistance.*** Sir Talavar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Sir Talavar's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components. As the dragon ages and changes color, it gains additional spells as shown below.

**1/day**: [color spray](/Systems/5e/spells/color-spray.md) (Orange), [mirror image](/Systems/5e/spells/mirror-image.md) (Yellow), [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md) (Green), [major image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md) (Blue), [hallucinatory terrain](/Systems/5e/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md) (Indigo), [polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/polymorph.md) (Violet)

**1/day each**: [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md)

## Actions

***+1 Tiny Sword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d4 + 6`) piercing damage.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 1 piercing damage.

***Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Sir Talavar exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a `d6` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:

- **1-4.** The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.  
- **5-6.** The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
