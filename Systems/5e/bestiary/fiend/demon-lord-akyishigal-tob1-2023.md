# Demon Lord Akyishigal
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 74*  

*This insectoid creature's filth-slicked mandibles clack ceaselessly for flesh.*

Of all the demons lurking in the Abyss, few are as vile and disgusting as Akyishigal, the Lord of Cockroaches.

## Civilization's Corruption

Although Akyishigal sired an entire race in his image, known as roachlings, he craves followers among humans, elves, and other races as a means of corrupting civilization and rotting it from within. Despite his repulsiveness, Akyishigal has followers among the urban dispossessed, the slum-dwelling poor, and those who lurk in lightless undercities. His shrines are tended in abandoned houses, tanneries, and butcher yards, as well as in sewers and similar places.

## Filth Sacrifices

In his shrines, kidnapped victims find themselves submerged in filth up to their necks. While the demon lord's cultists chant, sacramental roaches feast on the prisoner's eyes and tongue. A victim who survives the rite is dumped back onto the streets.

## Persistent Cults

Akyishigal's cults are almost as difficult to stamp out as real cockroach infestations. No matter how they are driven off or crushed, followers resurface among the teeming mobs of the downtrodden. Typical worshipers include evil humanoids, particularly kobolds and goblins, as well as roachlings, minor demons, slaves, thralls, and shadow creatures of all stripes.

## Traits

***Cloak of Swarms.*** Akyishigal emits a cloud of flying, stinging insects from his mouth, eyes, and tears in his skin that spreads out in a 5-foot radius from him. At the start of each of his turns, Akyishigal chooses whether this cloak is active.

While this cloak is active, Akyishigal has disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks, and creatures attacking Akyishigal can't benefit from traits and features that rely on a creature's allies distracting or surrounding the demon, such as the Pack Tactics trait or Sneak Attack feature. In addition, each creature that isn't a Construct or Undead that starts its turn in the cloud takes 11 (`2d10`) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) poison damage and become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature emits a stench of decomposition, and uncontrolled insects attack that creature in preference to other targets.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Akyishigal fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Akyishigal has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Akyishigal casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md)

**1/day**: [contagion](/Systems/5e/spells/contagion.md) (filth fever only)

**3/day**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [giant insect](/Systems/5e/spells/giant-insect.md), [insect plague](/Systems/5e/spells/insect-plague.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Akyishigal makes four Claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) slashing damage plus 3 (`1d6`) poison damage.

***Call Spawn (1/Day).*** Akyishigal magically calls one spawn of Akyishigal. The spawn arrives in `1d4` rounds, acting as an ally of Akyishigal and obeying its telepathic commands. The spawn remains for 1 hour, until Akyishigal dies, or until Akyishigal dismisses it as a bonus action.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** Akyishigal magically transforms into a Large or smaller insectoid Beast or back into his true form, which is a Fiend. His statistics, other than his size, are the same in each form. Any equipment he is wearing or carrying transforms with him. He reverts to his true form if he dies.

## Legendary Actions

***Teleport.*** Akyishigal magically teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.

***Skitter (Costs 2 Actions).*** Akyishigal moves up to half his speed and makes one Claw attack. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** Akyishigal uses Spellcasting.
