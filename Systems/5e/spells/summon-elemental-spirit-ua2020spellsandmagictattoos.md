# Summon Elemental Spirit
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, air, a pebble, ash, and water inside a crystal vial worth at least 400 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a spirit from the Elemental Planes. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Elemental Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature physically resembles a vaguely humanoid form wreathed in the chosen element, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell's duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.

**Classes**: [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
