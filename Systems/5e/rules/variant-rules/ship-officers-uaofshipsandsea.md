# Ship Officers
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 5* 

If you'd like to explore running a ship, it needs officers to oversee its operationsâ€”officers who fill six different roles. A person can fill only one role at a time, though multiple people can be assigned to a single role. Some roles aboard a ship reflect the need for trained experts to direct a crew's efforts. Others focus on keeping the crew's health and morale in order.

Each role is described below, along with the abilities and proficiencies that help a character excel at it (but that aren't required):

- **Captain.** The captain issues orders. The best captains have high Intelligence and Charisma scores, as well as proficiency with water vehicles and the [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) and [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skills.  
- **First Mate.** This specialist keeps the crew's morale up by providing close supervision, encouragement, and discipline. A first mate benefits from a high Charisma score, as well as proficiency with the [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) and [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skills.  
- **Bosun.** The bosun (or boatswain) provides technical advice to the captain and crew and leads repair and maintenance efforts. A good bosun has a high Strength score, as well as proficiency with [carpenter's tools](/Systems/5e/items/carpenters-tools.md) and the [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics) skill.  
- **Quartermaster.** The quartermaster plots the ship's course, relying on knowledge of nautical charts and a study of weather and sea conditions. A reliable quartermaster tends to have a high Wisdom score, as well as proficiency with [navigator's tools](/Systems/5e/items/navigators-tools.md) and the [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature) skill.  
- **Surgeon.** The ship's surgeon tends to injuries, keeps illnesses from spreading throughout the ship, and oversees sanitation. A capable surgeon benefits from a high Intelligence score, as well as proficiency with herbalism kits and the [Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine) skill.  
- **Cook.** A ship's cook works with the limited ingredients aboard a ship to make meals. A skilled cook keeps the crew's morale in top shape, while a poor one drags down the entire crew's performance. A talented cook has a high Constitution score, as well as proficiency with [brewer's supplies](/Systems/5e/items/brewers-supplies.md) and [cook's utensils](/Systems/5e/items/cooks-utensils.md).
