- **Alternate Names**: Moradin
- **Alignment**: Lawful Good
- **Category**: Prime Deities
- **Domains**: Forge, Knowledge, War
- **Pantheon**: Exandria
- **Province**: Craft, creation
- **Symbol**: A holy symbol shaped like two hammers, back to back, and in profile, with a rectangular ruby in the center between them. The face of each hammer is shaped to look like the head of a bearded dwarf.

The patron of craft and creation, the All-Hammer is worshipped by smiths, artisans, and miners alike, granting inspiration where respect and prayer are given. He shaped the mountains from the chaos of the "Founding", and stands as the patron protector of home and family. Devotion to the All-Hammer is strongest in dwarven communities, and many of his temples mark the center of a mighty dwarven stronghold.

## Depiction

Many guildhalls and workshops contain images of the All-Hammer, a faceless, stout dwarf of immense strength, hunched over a flaming heart clasped within his massive hands. The All-Hammer's dwarven appearance is consistent across Tal'Dorei, with some exceptions. Other cultures that pride themselves on their metallurgy, like the fire giant enclave of "Vulkanon", depict the All-Hammer as one of their ownâ€”in this case, a faceless giant with a flaming mane.

## Divine Domains

Many of the All-Hammer's clerics are granted powers of Forge, Knowledge, or War.

## Holy Day

The All-Hammer's holy day is Deep Solace, celebrated on the eighteenth day of the fifth month. Especially devout followers of the All-Hammer spend the day in isolation, meditating on the meaning of family and how they may be better mothers, fathers, siblings, and children. Dwarven communities in "Kraghammer" and abroad celebrate with a full day of feasting and drinking.
