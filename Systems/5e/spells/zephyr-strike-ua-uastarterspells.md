*1st-level, Transmutation*

You move like the wind. For the duration, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

In addition, the first time you make a weapon attack on your turn before the spell ends, you make the attack roll with advantage, and your speed increases by 30 feet until the end of that turn.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md)
