# Vampire Null
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 28*  

The various forms of undead ghosts are the incorporeal remnants of life and personality left after the death of a mortal body. But sometimes the reverse is true: a body retains its animation and hunger while losing any trace of its soul, becoming a zombie. When a vampire who is not a bloodchief drains the blood from a living humanoid, that creature undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a stronger, faster version of a [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) called a null. Nulls' heads are featureless except for a gaping mouth filled with jagged teeth. Their bodies are shriveled and distorted, but preternaturally strong. They are mindlessly loyal servants to the vampire nobility, and the number of nulls under a vampire's control is a mark of status and power among the vampire houses of Guul Draz.
