## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Corrode Metal.*** Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.

The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance.*** While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** As an action, it can make two attacks with its pseudopods.

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`6d6`) acid damage, or 42 (`12d6`) acid damage while the ooze is enlarged. If the target is wearing nonmagical metal armor, its armor is partly corroded and takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10.

***Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the ooze magically increases in size. While enlarged, the ooze is Gargantuan, doubles its damage dice with its pseudopod attack, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage.

***Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The ooze magically turns [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) for up to 1 hour until it attacks, it uses its Enlarge, or its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) is broken (as if concentrating on a spell).
