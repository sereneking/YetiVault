| dice: d8 | Defining Event |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | I was well celebrated in my city as a slayer of a great troll. |
| 2 | I witnessed the death of my family during the civil war. They were targets for their ties to the von Kessel name. |
| 3 | I led my knights to victory in defending our castle during a raid in the war. |
| 4 | I lost a lot of good soldiers in an earlier expedition into Drakkenheim. We never made it past the gate. |
| 5 | My house was an enemy of the von Kessel family and had many battles with them. |
| 6 | I broke ties with my family when they folded to the Silver Order. |
| 7 | I am related, not to a king or queen, but to a noble figure who sat in the small council and made important decisions for their represented house. |
| 8 | My family lost everything in the destruction of Drakkenheim. We are noble only in name, no longer in standing. |

**Suggested Characteristics**

`dice: [](continental-nobility-last-of-the-line-variant-dodk.md#^suggested-characteristics)`

| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I consider myself a renowned monster slayer, and like to remind everyone of the many accomplishments I hold to my name. |
| 2 | I keep family traditions close. Honour and family are amongst the most important things in the world, and I cherish them. |
| 3 | I miss the comforts of my home. This city is dirty and smells terrible. |
| 4 | I believe in the good in people, and I hope to find a peaceful resolution to our problems. A diplomatic approach is something Westemär greatly needs. |
| 5 | As a noble, I have a responsibility to protect those who cannot protect themselves. |
| 6 | It is highly important that I look my best and maintain my regal demeanor in all situations. My reputation must go untarnished. |
| 7 | I may be of noble birth, but have lived life on the road for some time. I am more than willing to share what I have with others, as I am no better or worse than anyone else. |
| 8 | There is no challenge I can't face. I heard about the horrors and monsters of this world, and I am what they fear the most. |

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Respect. I am a respected member of my family, and I expect what remains of Drakkenheim's nobility and royal line to acknowledge my standing. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Responsibility. It is my responsibility as a representative of my noble line to remain cordial, and diplomatic in dealings with the various high ranking members of Drakkenheim's society. (Good) |
| 3 | Privacy. I do not wish for my nobility to come up. It may be best if the people of Drakkenheim do not know who I am. At least for now. (Any) |
| 4 | Duty. It is my duty to aid the people of Drakkenheim. As a noble I was connected to this city, and it is what is expected of me. (Good) |
| 5 | Glory. I must claim my victories and prove myself in battle. (Any) |
| 6 | Family. Blood is thicker than water and I will fight to defend my family's honour. (Good) |

| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I must prove myself as a great warrior for my house and my people. |
| 2 | My family was once bound to the royal family of Westemär, I must ensure we remain bound to whoever takes the throne. |
| 3 | My family's fortune was lost. Drakkenheim may be our last chance to get it back. |
| 4 | My family was betrayed by one of the royal houses, and I plan to make sure any that remain of that name are brought to justice and my family takes its place where it belongs. |
| 5 | I am destined to rule, as my ancestors before me have. |
| 6 | I have been sent unwillingly on a diplomatic mission to Drakkenheim. I am to gain political standing in these crumbling ruins. |

| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I boast about my own triumphs, and belittle the accomplishments of others. |
| 2 | Bound by honor, I can never back down from a challenge, nor can I let those who undervalue my name go unchallenged. |
| 3 | I do not like getting my hands dirty. Other people must do the heavy lifting, not me. |
| 4 | I like to flaunt my wealth, and I spare no expense. |
| 5 | I'm never wrong. Even if I was, I would never admit it. |
| 6 | I was forced to lead, but I am very far out of my depth and desperately hoping people do not catch on that I don't know what I am doing here. |
