# Blessed Warrior
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 6*  

You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip from the cleric spell list.
