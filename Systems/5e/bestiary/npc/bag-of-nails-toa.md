# Bag of Nails
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 102*  

Bag of Nails yearns for a hunter's death. Senility has taken hold, and now he sees all creatures as his prey.

He explains that he came to Omu to find a fabled treasure called the Navel of the Moon. He hoped to use its alleged powers to find his lost son, but he has long since given up hope of ever finding it.

## Traits

***Feline Agility.*** When Bag of Nails moves on its turn in combat, he can double his speed until the end of the turn. Once he uses this trait, Bag of Nails can't use it again until he moves 0 feet on one of his turns.

***Assassinate.*** During his first turn, Bag of Nails has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Bag of Nails scores against a [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Bag of Nails is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Bag of Nails instead takes no damage if he succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** Bag of Nails deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) damage when he hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of his that isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and Bag of Nails doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
