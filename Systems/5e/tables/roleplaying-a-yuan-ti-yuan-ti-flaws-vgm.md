| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I feel twinges of emotion, and it shames me that I am imperfect in this way. |
| 2 | I put too much credence in the dictates of a particular god. |
| 3 | I frequently overindulge in food and wine, and I am impaired and lethargic for days afterward. |
| 4 | I worship a forbidden god. |
| 5 | I secretly believe things would be better if I was in charge. |
| 6 | If I could get away with it, I would gladly kill and eat a superior yuan-ti. |
