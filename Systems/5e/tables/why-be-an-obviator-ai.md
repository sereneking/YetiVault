| 1 | There's nothing that excites you more than a puzzle you can't immediately solve. |
| 2 | Your favorite saying is, "All according to plan." Especially when you have no idea what's going on. |
| 3 | You have an entire room dedicated to notes and sketches connected by red yarn. |
| 4 | Your plans are so detailed that they have plans of their own. |
| 5 | You find the little details so much more interesting than... well, anything else. |
| 6 | You already had the chemical burns on your hands. Might as well make it official. |
| 7 | Methodical. Calculating. Brilliant. One day, you hope these words will apply to you. |
| 8 | It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you. And if you're out to get them first. |
