## Traits

***Reduced Threat.*** A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies), saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and saving throw DCs (included in the stat block).

***Magic Resistance.*** The glabrezu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The glabrezu's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14). The glabrezu can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md)

**1/day each**: [confusion](/Systems/5e/spells/confusion.md), [fly](/Systems/5e/spells/fly.md), [power word stun](/Systems/5e/spells/power-word-stun.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The glabrezu makes four attacks: two with its pincers and two with its fists. Alternatively, it makes two attacks with its pincers and casts one spell.

***Pincer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13). The glabrezu has two pincers, each of which can grapple only one target.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.
