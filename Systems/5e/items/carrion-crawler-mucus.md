# Carrion Crawler Mucus
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  

- **Cost**: 200 gp

This poison must be harvested from a dead or [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) [carrion crawler](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/carrion-crawler.md). A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature is [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed). The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
