# Malaxxix

## Lair actions


In its lair on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Malaxxix can take one of the following lair actions; Malaxxix can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Reassemble.** Malaxxix chooses either itself or the palanquin. The target gains 19 (`3d12`) temporary hit points.  
- **Slam.** Malaxxix commands the palanquin to slam the ground. Each creature within 15 feet of the palanquin must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage and has the prone condition. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.  
- **Surge.** Malaxxix commands the palanquin to move up to its speed.  

## Regional effects


The region around the Unborn Palanquin is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Cranial Discomfort.** Creatures that spend more than 24 hours within 1 mile of the palanquin hear an incessant scraping sound in their minds.  
- **Grinding Gears.** Constructs within 1 mile of the palanquin move sluggishly. Constructs' speeds are halved, and they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.  
- **Swarming Insects.** Insects and insectile Beasts within 1 mile of the palanquin become disoriented and aggressive, coalescing into unnatural swarms and attacking any creatures in sight.  

If Malaxxix dies or the Unborn Palanquin is destroyed, these effects end immediately.
