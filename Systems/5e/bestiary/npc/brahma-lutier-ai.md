# Brahma Lutier
*Source: Acquisitions Incorporated p. 205*  

Formally a former member of the "B" Team, Brahma Lutier is a gifted cartographer, spy, and troubadour. Tutored in at least the latter of those vocations by Audra Courtier (wife of Propha Dran and co-owner of the Dran & Courtier inn of Red Larch), Brahma's specialty is a song of domination that is legendarily difficult to resist.

Her retirement is said to be connected to a falling out with husband Oak Truestrike, and Brahma has been operating as a solo agent for some time now. Known for a personality that is murderous and cheery in equal part, she utilizes an instrument of dragonborn design in combat. Known as a war lute, this unique item comes replete with hidden storage and powerful weaponry.

## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** Brahma has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put her to sleep.

***Taunt (2/Day).*** Brahma can use a bonus action to target one creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can hear Brahma, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws until the start of Brahma's next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** Brahma is a 4th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, `+5` to hit with spell attacks). She has the following bard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [message](/Systems/5e/spells/message.md), [vicious mockery](/Systems/5e/spells/vicious-mockery.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [heroism](/Systems/5e/spells/heroism.md), [illusory script](/Systems/5e/spells/illusory-script.md), [sleep](/Systems/5e/spells/sleep.md), [unseen servant](/Systems/5e/spells/unseen-servant.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [cloud of daggers](/Systems/5e/spells/cloud-of-daggers.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md)

## Actions

***War Lute.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Song of Domination (3/Day).*** Brahma targets one creature that can see or hear her, which must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by her for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. It has disadvantage on these saves if being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by Brahma is something the target openly or secretly desires. For 1 hour after the charm effect ends, the target has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma checks made as part of a contest with Brahma.
