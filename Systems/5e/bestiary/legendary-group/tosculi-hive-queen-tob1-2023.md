# Tosculi Hive Queen

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the hive queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the hive queen can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Biting Brood.** Hundreds of biting and stinging insects erupt from a point on the ground the hive queen can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`4d4`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Healing Pheromones.** Each tosculi within 60 feet of the hive queen (including the hive queen) regains 10 `3d6` hp.  
- **Restraining Resin.** The ceiling above one creature that the hive-queen can see within 120 feet of her drips sticky resin. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by rapidly-hardening resin. A creature, including the target, can take its action to free the restrained target by succeeding on a DC 17 Strength check. If the creature is still restrained by the resin on initiative count 20 of the next round, the resin fully hardens, and the target is petrified in amber until freed or until the hive queen uses this lair action again. The resin can be attacked and destroyed (AC 15; 20 hp; vulnerability to bludgeoning damage; immunity to piercing, poison, and psychic damage), freeing the target.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a tosculi hive queen's lair is warped by her presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Aggressive Wildlife.** Beasts within 6 miles of the lair are more violent than usual and prone to acts of aggression.  
- **Buzzing Migraine.** Creatures with an Intelligence of 5 or higher within 3 miles of the lair frequently suffer headaches brought on by an insectile buzzing in their minds.  
- **Eyes and Ears Everywhere.** The hive queen can choose to see or hear through the senses of any tosculi within 10 miles of her lair, provided the tosculi is a member of her hive.  

If the tosculi hive-queen dies, the buzzing disappears immediately, but other effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
