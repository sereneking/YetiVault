# Throne Card
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  


As an action, you can speak a command word while holding this card to gain advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks for 1 minute. In addition, for that duration, you can use this card to cast the [Command](/Systems/5e/spells/command.md) spell (save DC 17) as an action. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
