# Healing Draught
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 5*  

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a vial of healing liquid. A creature can drink it as an action to regain `1d8` hit points. The vial then disappears. Once a creature regains hit points from this alchemical formula, the creature can't do so again until it finishes a long rest. If not used, the vial and its contents disappear after 1 hour. While the vial exists, you can't use this formula. This formula's healing increases by `1d8` when you reach certain levels in this class: 3rd level (`2d8`), 5th level (`3d8`), 7th level (`4d8`), 9th level (`5d8`), 11th level (`6d8`), 13th level (`7d8`), 15th level (`8d8`), 17th level (`9d8`), and 19th level (`10d8`).
