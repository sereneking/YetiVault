*Source: Adventure Atlas: The Mortuary* 

**Mortuary Encounters (Levels 1—4)**

`dice: [](mortuary-encounters-levels-14-aatm.md#^mortuary-encounters-levels-14)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | A decapitated [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) with the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened) conditions scrabbles along the ground, looking for its head. The zombie attacks any creature it detects. |
| 2 | `1d4` [will-o'-wisps](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/will-o-wisp.md) offer to guide the characters to their destination but might lead them to a deadly location in the Mortuary, such as a crematorium. |
| 3 | A poshly dressed Duster [wight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/wight.md) asks the characters to help them write a eulogy that's due in 10 minutes. |
| 4 | A friendly [death dog](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/death-dog.md) trots up to the characters and drops a bony hand at their feet. The dog wants to play fetch. |
| 5 | Ten melancholy Dusters ([commoners](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) conduct an open-casket funeral for a cheery [skeleton](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) named Merle, who never received one in life. Merle lies in the casket but occasionally sits up to hear his own eulogies. The Dusters ask the characters if they'd like to say anything on behalf of the deceased. |
| 6 | A lost [animated coffin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-coffin-aatm.md)* lurches along, carrying a reverently laid corpse to its crypt. The Construct approaches the characters and silently petitions them to escort it to its destination. |
| 7 | `1d4` [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), bloated and riddled with holes, shuffle up to the characters and each expel a [swarm of rot grubs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rot-grubs-mpmm.md)† at their feet. All the creatures are hostile toward the characters. |
| 8 | A [Heralds of Dust exorcist](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/heralds-of-dust-exorcist-aatm.md)* works to expel a [dybbuk](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/dybbuk-mpmm.md)† from a corpse. The exorcist asks the characters to help in dispatch the Fiend. |
| 9 | Two [bards](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/bard-mpmm.md)† in the Heralds of Dust approach the characters and sing a ballad honoring the dead. If the characters interrupt or otherwise ruin the tune, `1d4` irascible [specters](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) emerge from the walls and attack, causing the bards to flee. |
| 10 | Three [skeleton](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) farmers quietly tend to corpse-white grave flowers in an underground garden. Four [stench kows](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/stench-kow-mpmm.md)† graze nearby and protect the farmers, who attack if the characters pluck any flowers or interfere with their work. |
