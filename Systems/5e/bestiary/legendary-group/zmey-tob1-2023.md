# Zmey

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the zmey takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Hinder Movement.** One hostile creature the zmey can see within 120 feet of it has its speed halved until initiative count 20 on the next round, as roots trip up walking and hanging branches and vines dangle in the way of flight.  
- **Invigorate Headlings.** One severed zmey head the zmey can see within 120 feet of it immediately grows into a zmey headling, or one slain zmey headling the zmey can see within 120 feet of it regains 10 hp and becomes active again. A severed head or zmey headling smeared in a pound of salt can't be affected by this lair action.  
- **Spread Forest's Gloom.** Light reduces in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point the zmey can see within 120 feet of it. Bright light becomes dim light, dim light becomes darkness, and darkness becomes magical darkness in the sphere. The sphere lasts until the zmey dismisses it as an action, uses this lair action again, or dies.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the zmey's lair is warped by the link between the creature and its forest home, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Fear and Rage.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel constantly on the verge of an overwhelming fight-or-flight response, keeping them on edge and making their sleep fitful.  
- **Unfriendly Forest.** The forest within 6 miles of the lair is as uninviting as possible to those not native to it: unattended fires tend to go out mysteriously and new fires are hard to start, flora and fauna slain or foraged spoil almost immediately, and similar.  
- **Unnerving Presence.** Creatures within 3 miles of the lair are unsettled by the forest and frequently distracted by phantom chattering, tricks of the light, and other sensations.  

If the zmey dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
