# Hierophant Medusa

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the medusa can take one of the following lair actions; the medusa can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Petrifying Wave.** Up to three creatures the medusa can see within the lair are partially turned to stone. Each target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target's speed is reduced to 0 and can't increase. On a successful save, its speed is halved. The target's speed returns to normal on initiative count 20 on the following round.  
- **Sudden Stonework.** The medusa creates a wall of stone on a solid surface it can see within the lair. The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. Each 5-foot section of the wall has an AC of 17; 30 hit points; vulnerability to thunder damage; and immunity to poison, psychic, and slashing damage. A creature in the wall's space when the wall appears is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space on one side of the wall and must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the medusa chooses the side. On a successful save, the creature chooses the side. The wall disappears when the medusa uses this lair action again or when the medusa dies.  
- **Undulating Surface.** Solid surfaces within the lair ripple like a snake's coils. Up to three creatures the medusa can see within the lair can move up to 30 feet along solid surfaces without provoking opportunity attacks. If a creature moves along a surface such as a ceiling with no way to remain there (for example, sufficient handholds), it falls at the end of this movement.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a medusa's lair is altered by the medusa's presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Faces in Stone.** Stone within 3 miles of the lair takes on subtle shapes that suggest people, animals, and other creatures when viewed from the corner of the eye or through dim light or fog.  
- **Gathered Knowledge.** Within the lair, creatures have advantage on ability checks made to discover or recall information relevant to the medusa's divine purpose.  

If the medusa dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
