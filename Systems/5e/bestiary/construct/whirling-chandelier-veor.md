# Whirling Chandelier
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 239*  

Compared to other animated objects, whirling chandeliers seem to have capricious personalities. Victims typically perceive a whirling chandelier's Blazing Vortex as mischievousness or outright malevolence, though the chandelier lacks any understanding of such concepts. A whirling chandelier makes tactical decisions only as a means to perform its master's orders to the best of its ability.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the chandelier is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the chandelier move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the chandelier is animate.

***Fiery Aura.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the chandelier takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The chandelier makes three Chain attacks, three Lamp attacks, or a combination thereof.

***Chain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the chandelier.

***Lamp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`2d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (`3d8`) fire damage.

***Blazing Vortex (Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature within 20 feet of the chandelier and not behind total cover must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 36 (`8d8`) fire damage and have the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) condition until the start of the chandelier's next turn.
