# Giant Zombie Constrictor Snake
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night p. 11*  

These enormous, rotten husks were living, Medium-sized constrictors when the yuan-ti brought them to honor and entice Kyrilla to share her knowledge and powers. They grew to their full, Huge size on a diet of supplicants and prisoners, many of whose bones can be found elsewhere in the lair. When the yuan-ti turned against Kyrilla, they fought and slew these snakes—only to find them slithering again through cursed, ambient magic in Kyrilla's lair.

The constrictors die if they leave the lair.

## Traits

***Sunlight Vulnerability.*** While in sunlight, the snake has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. When the snake begins its turn in sunlight, it immediately suffers 10 radiant damage.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the snake to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the snake drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The snake makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with a constrict attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`3d8 + 4`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`3d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the creature is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and the snake cannot constrict another target.
