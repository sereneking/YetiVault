# Knight of the Sword
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Sword, a group devoted to heroism and courage. Bravery steels your spirit, granting you these benefits:

- **Disciplined Spirit.** You gain proficiency in Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws (your choice when you take this feat).  
- **Willpower.** Immediately after you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you fail an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can expend a Hit Die. The saving throw increases by an amount equal to a roll of that Hit Die, potentially turning a failure into a success. Once you turn a failed saving throw into a successful one using this feat, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.  

> [!note] Membership in Multiple Knightly Orders
> 
> Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.
