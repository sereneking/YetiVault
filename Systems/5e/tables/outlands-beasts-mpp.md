**Outlands Beasts**

`dice: [](outlands-beasts-mpp.md#^outlands-beasts)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | An awakened [giant scorpion](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-scorpion.md) owns a custom-made boat and runs a ferry business along a prominent river. It offers its services to characters in need. |
| 2 | A [triceratops](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/triceratops.md) influenced by "Mechanus" and composed of simple geometric shapes charges creatures that enter the angular canyons it inhabits. It moves only in straight lines and turns only at right angles. |
| 3 | [Stirges](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/stirge.md) drawn from countless worlds congregate in a tornado-sized, bloodsucking cloud that threatens a gate-town. |
| 4 | A desiccated [giant frog](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-frog.md) influenced by "Pandemonium" screams whenever it opens its mouth. Its interior is even noisier. |
