# Faerie Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

As they are presented in the "Monster Manual", faerie dragons don't have access to lair actions while in their lairs. At your discretion, a [green](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-green.md) or [older faerie dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-violet.md) can take one of the following lair actions on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties):

- **Chaotic Aura.** The faerie dragon creates misdirecting currents of air and magic around itself. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, whenever a ranged attack roll misses the dragon, reroll the attack against a random creature within 30 feet of the dragon that doesn't have total cover against the attack.  
- **Grasping Plants.** The faerie dragon causes roots and vines to temporarily grow around it; until initiative count 20 on the next round, the ground within 20 feet of the dragon is "difficult terrain".  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region containing a faerie dragon's lair can be transformed by its presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Compulsory Offering.** The first time a creature comes within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or feel an overwhelming compulsion to leave an offering worth at least 5 gp stashed in an out-of-the-way place. The dragon immediately senses the location of this gift. A creature can be affected only once by this compulsion.  
- **Malleable Time.** Time is fluid within 1 mile of the faerie dragon's lair, flowing somewhere between half and twice its normal speed.  
- **Mischief Afoot.** Sapient creatures that spend a year within 5 miles of the faerie dragon's lair feel the persistent urge to play pranks on others.  

If the faerie dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
