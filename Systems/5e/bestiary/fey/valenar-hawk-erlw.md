# Valenar Hawk
*Source: Eberron: Rising from the Last War p. 312*  

The elves of Valenar say that when their ancestors fought the giants of Xen'drik, elf druids took the forms of animals on the battlefield. The cruel and mighty Emperor Cul'sir of the giants laid a curse upon the druids and trapped them in the forms of animals. Just as the ancestors of the Valenar guide their warriors in battle, the spirits of these druids can awaken power in an animal to create a companion worthy of a champion.

Valenar animals are awakened to advanced intelligence and power by the touch of an ancestral spirit. Traditionally, Valenar animals choose Valenar elves as companions, reflecting a bond between the ancestors of elf and animal. To be chosen by a Valenar animal is a great honor, and any such elf is treated with respect and reverence. Still, on the rare occasions when a Valenar animal chooses an adventurer of a different ancestry as a companion, it is universally accepted.

The Valenar animals presented here—hawk, hound, and steed—are but examples, for the ancestral spirits can take on many animal forms.

## Variant: Ancestral Traits

Each Valenar animal can be customized with an ancestral gift, a supernatural trait granted by its ancestral spirit. Choose a trait or roll on the Ancestral Traits table for each Valenar animal.
