| Donjon (or A ♠) | As an action, you are transported to an empty demiplane until the end of your next turn. You can't affect or be affected by anything on the plane you left until you return. You return to the same space you left or, if that space is occupied, to the nearest unoccupied space. |

| Star (or J ♦) | Gain advantage on an ability check. |
| Sun (or K ♦) | As a reaction, when a creature makes a melee attack that hits you, that creature has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) condition until the end of your next turn. |
| Talons (or A ♣) | As a bonus action, reduce the speed of one creature within 5 feet of you to 0 until the start of your next turn. |
