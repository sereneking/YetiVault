# Amphiptere
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 16*  

*A flight of gold-crested, bat-winged serpents bursts from the foliage.*

## Tiny Wyverns

An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger similar to a wyvern's at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.

## Swooping and Swift

They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.

## Strength in Flocks

Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.
