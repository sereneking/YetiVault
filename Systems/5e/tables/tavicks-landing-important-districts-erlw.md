| District | Description | Location |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Copper Arch | This district is built around the Deneith garrison that polices the upper ward. It contains shops and services catering to the wealthy elite. | Upper Tavick's Landing |
| Ocean View | This residential district is home to some of the most influential citizens of Sharn. It has a mix of wealthy mansions and aristocratic estates. | Upper Tavick's Landing |
| Silvergate | This shopping district is patronized by those with gold to spare. All manner of fine jewelry and expensive clothing can be found here, along with aristocratic food and lodging. | Upper Tavick's Landing |
| Sunrise | This district provides housing for the shopkeepers and servants who keep Upper Tavick's Landing running. Housing is largely modest in quality, with a few comfortable towers. | Upper Tavick's Landing |
| Twelve Pillars | This is the civic heart of Upper Tavick's Landing. The twelve pillars it's named for surround a courthouse, the Tower of Law, where visitors can get licenses to carry weapons in the ward. | Upper Tavick's Landing |
| Cornerstone | A haven for travelers, Cornerstone has a range of comfortable inns and taverns. It's built around the vast Cornerstone arena and is a center of activity for many major sporting events. | Middle Tavick's Landing |
| Deathsgate | Named for the nearby City of the Dead, this district houses the Deathsgate Guild and businesses that cater to adventurers. House Deneith recruits mercenaries at its outpost here. | Middle Tavick's Landing |
| Graywall | This district was founded long ago by Karrnathi immigrants, and its people are proud of their heritage. It is a haven for any Karrnathi travelers passing through Sharn. Rumors say there's a temple devoted to the Blood of Vol in Graywall, but if that's the case, it's kept hidden. | Middle Tavick's Landing |
| Tavick's Market | This district specializes in produce and other goods brought in by the farmers from the surrounding countryside. | Middle Tavick's Landing |
| Black Arch | This district is filled with checkpoints and enchanted gates. These portals are generally open, but in times of trouble, Black Arch can become an impassable fortress. The Sharn Watch maintains the local garrison. House Orien and House Sivis both maintain outposts here, ensuring that messages can be swiftly delivered through the city and beyond. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
| Cogsgate | This warehouse district is the gateway to the Cogs, and shipments of ore and other goods regularly pass through here. House Kundarak has high-security storage facilities for rent, and a House Deneith outpost hires out Blademark mercenaries for venturing below. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
| Dragoneyes | Dragoneyes tends to the needs of weary travelers, providing a wide range of lodging, food, and entertainment for tourists. It's also the home of most of Sharn's changeling population, and many changelings use their gifts to entertain and amuse travelers. Some say that it's the home of the Tyrants criminal guild, but if so, that place is well hidden. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
| High Walls | This district was converted into an internment center during the Last War. Since the end of the war, it has been transformed into a refugee camp. Most of the residents are Cyrans who fled the Mourning, but High Walls also includes Brelish citizens who lost their homes in the war. It's a crowded and dangerous place, but it allows residents to maintain a squalid lifestyle at no cost. Currently the gates are open, but the Sharn Watch could seal them at any time. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
| Terminus | This district is based around Terminus Station, where the lightning rail enters and leaves Sharn. Most local businesses serve the station or travelers. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
| Wroann's Gate | Travelers who arrive on the main road enter Sharn through Wroann's Gate, passing below a huge statue of the legendary Queen Wroaan. Many of the dragonmarked houses maintain shops here so travelers can send messages, hire bodyguards, or make use of other services. | Lower Tavick's Landing |
