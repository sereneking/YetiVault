# Haze Wight
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 198*  

A haze wight is more sentient than their haze husk minions, but has still been stripped of their former life. Many were former adventurers, military officers, or mighty warriors who died in the Haze. Many still believe themselves to be great heroes rallying the common folk of Drakkenheim against invaders, but in their madness they see all humanoids as monsters.
