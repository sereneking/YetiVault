**Group Rivals**

`dice: [](rival-outfit-group-rivals-erlw.md#^group-rivals)`

| dice: d6 | Rival |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **The Law**. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying. |
| 2 | **Gang War**. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason. |
| 3 | **The Press**. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists. |
| 4 | **Infighting**. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you. |
| 5 | **Vigilante**. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood. |
| 6 | **The Bosses**. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal. |
