## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** Severin has the [Mask of the Dragon Queen](/Systems/5e/items/mask-of-the-dragon-queen-rot.md).

***Draconic Majesty.*** Severin adds his Charisma bonus to his AC (included).

***Ignite Enemy.*** If Severin deals fire damage to a creature while wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, the target catches fire. At the start of each of its turns, the burning target takes 5 (`1d10`) fire damage. A creature within reach of the fire can use an action to extinguish it.

***Legendary Resistance (5/Day).*** While wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, if Severin fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Burning Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`4d8`) fire damage.

***Flaming Orb.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, range 90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`9d8`) fire damage.

***Scorching Burst.*** Severin chooses a point he can see within 60 feet of him. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

If Severin is wearing the Mask of the Dragon Queen, he can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options listed. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Severin regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Attack.*** Severin makes one attack.

***Fiery Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).*** Severin, along with any objects he is wearing or carrying, teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. Each creature within 5 feet of Severin before he teleports takes 5 (`1d10`) fire damage.

***Hellish Chains (Costs 3 Actions).*** Severin targets one creature he can see within 30 feet of him. The target is wrapped in magical chains of fire and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target takes 21 (`6d6`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of its turns, the target can make a DC 17 Strength saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
