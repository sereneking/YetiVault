- **Armor**: light
- **Weapons**: simple
- **Tools**: none
- **Skills**: Choose 3 from *Arcana*, *History*, *Insight*, *Investigation*, *Medicine*, *Performance*, *Persuasion*, *Religion*


## Class Features

### Sidekick Class (Level 1)

To gain the spellcaster class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

> [!note]
> this class is intended for NPC [sidekicks](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/sidekicks-uasidekicks.md).

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

When the sidekick joins this class, the sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in three skills of your choice from the following list: [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History), [Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight), [Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation), [Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine), [Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance), [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion), and [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion). If the sidekick is a humanoid, it also gains proficiency with simple weapons and light armor.

### Spellcasting (Level 1)

At 1st level, the sidekick gains the ability to cast spells. (If the creature already has the Spellcasting trait, this feature replaces that trait.) Choose a class: bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard. This choice determines the spell list, spellcasting ability, and spellcasting focus used by the sidekick, as shown on the Spellcasting table.

**Spellcasting**

| Spell List | Ability | Focus |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Bard | Charisma | Musical instrument |
| Cleric | Wisdom | [Holy Symbol](/Systems/5e/items/holy-symbol.md) |
| Druid | Wisdom | [Druidic Focus](/Systems/5e/items/druidic-focus.md) |
| Sorcerer | Charisma | [Arcane Focus](/Systems/5e/items/arcane-focus.md) |
| Warlock | Charisma | [Arcane Focus](/Systems/5e/items/arcane-focus.md) |
| Wizard | Intelligence | [Arcane Focus](/Systems/5e/items/arcane-focus.md) |
^spellcasting

#### Cantrips

At first level, the sidekick knows three cantrips of your choice from its spell list. The sidekick learns additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Spellcaster table.

#### Spell Slots

The Spellcaster table shows how many spell slots the sidekick has to cast its spellcaster spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, the sidekick must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. The spellcaster regains all expended spell slots when it finishes a long rest.

For example, if the sidekick knows the 1st-level spell [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md) and has a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, it can cast the spell using either slot.

#### Spells Known

The sidekick knows three 1st-level spells of your choice from its spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Spellcaster table shows when the sidekick learns more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which the sidekick has spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance when the sidekick reaches 3rd level in this class, it can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when the sidekick gains a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells it knows from this class and replace it with another spell from its spell list, which also must be of a level for which it has spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability

The sidekick's spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table.

The sidekick uses its spellcasting ability whenever a spell refers to that ability. In addition, it uses its spellcasting ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell it casts and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC**: 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Spellcasting modifier

**Spell attack modifier**: your proficiency bonus + your Spellcasting modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

The sidekick can use a focus for its spells depending on the choice you made on the Spellcasting table.

### Magical Recovery (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, when the sidekick finishes a short rest, it can recover expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half its level in this class (rounded up), and none of the spell slots can be 6th level or higher.

Once the sidekick uses this feature, it can't use the feature again until it finishes a long rest.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Proficiency Versatility (Level 4)

### Potent Cantrips (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, the sidekick can add its spellcasting ability modifier to the damage it deals with any cantrip.

### Empowered Spells (Level 10)

### Signature Spells (Level 20)

At 20th level, choose two spells that the sidekick knows from this class. Eligible spells are of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd level. The sidekick can cast each of the chosen spell once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. After the sidekick casts a spell in this way, the sidekick regains the ability to cast that spell with this feature when it finishes a short or long rest.
