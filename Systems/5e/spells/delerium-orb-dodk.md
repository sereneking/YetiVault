# Delerium Orb
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a delerium fragment worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination. You draw chaotic magical power from the delerium fragment held in your hand, and blast a creature you can see within range with paradoxical power. Choose one ability score, then choose cold, fire, lightning, necrotic, psychic, or radiant damage. The target must succeed on a saving throw using the chosen ability score; it takes `6d6` damage of the chosen type on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md)
