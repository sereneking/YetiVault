# Hew Hackinstone
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 33*  

Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable berserkers come together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.

## Biography

Three years ago, Hew was part of a dwarven expedition seeking to reopen Wyrmheart Mine. The expedition encountered Tinder the red dragon. Hew alone escaped, and only after the dragon bit off his left arm. Hew wants to return to the mine and slay the dragon, but he needs a band of stout-hearted adventurers to help him. If the characters hire him as a guide, Hew says he can lead them wherever they want, but he'll only take them to Wyrmheart Mine.
