# Cairnwight
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 122*  

Stone giants believe the god Skoraeus Stonebones inspires artists to create their finest stone carvings. Sometimes a giant pursues this divine inspiration to the exclusion of all other tasks, retreating into a spacious cavern and blocking out all distractions. Creating a masterwork can become such a driving obsession that death can't stop it: a giant who dies while creating art might rise as a cairnwight and continue the work. Once the artwork is completed, the cairnwight remains as its undying guardian.

A cairnwight looks much like an emaciated stone giant. Its form is caked with lichens and mineral deposits, which help it blend with its cavern tomb. Should a creature attempt to interfere with the completion of the cairnwight's project, damage the art, or steal from the cairnwight, the giant petrifies the creature, places the resulting statue outside as a warning, then reseals its cavern vault.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The cairnwight makes two Slam attacks or two Rock attacks, and it uses its Petrifying Touch if available.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or have the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

***Petrifying Touch (Recharge 5-6).*** The cairnwight touches one creature it can see within 10 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 26 (`4d12`) force damage and have the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition as it begins to turn to stone. The affected target must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the effect ends on the target. On a failed save, the target has the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition instead of the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition.
