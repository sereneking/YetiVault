# Vampirate Captain
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 63, Light of Xaryxis*  

How a crew of vampirates conducts itself depends entirely on the mood and disposition of the captain. The crew of one ship might behave like a murderous mob, while another might abide by an ancient code of chivalry. One captain might allow the crew of a plundered ship to live, while another might leave only flotsam and jetsam in the pirates' wake.

The captain is often accompanied by an undying companion, such as a crawling claw or a will-o'-wisp.

## Traits

***Explode.*** When the captain is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) necrotic damage.

***Spider Climb.*** The captain can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Unusual Nature.*** The captain doesn't require air or drink.

## Actions

***Energy Drain.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow or vampirate (captain's choice) under the DM's control.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d10 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Ship Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** A ship upon which the captain stands, along with all creatures and objects aboard it, becomes [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to creatures not aboard the ship. The captain must concentrate on this magical effect to maintain it (as if concentrating on a spell), and it lasts for up to 1 hour. The effect ends if the captain leaves the ship.

## Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** The captain halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The captain must be able to see the attacker.
