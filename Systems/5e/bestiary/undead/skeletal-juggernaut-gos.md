# Skeletal Juggernaut
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 253, Infernal Machine Rebuild*  

As seen lumbering across the beaches in Isle of the Abbey, a skeletal juggernaut is an oversized, bipedal assembly of bones that loses a portion of its mass with each step. These skeletal guardians hold together for only a short time before disassembling into a gang of individual undead.

## Traits

***Disassemble.*** If the juggernaut is reduced to 0 hit points, twelve skeletons rise from its remains.

***Falling Apart.*** If the juggernaut does not have all of its hit points at the start of its turn, it loses 10 hit points.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The juggernaut makes two claws attacks.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Avalanche of Bones (Recharge 5-6).*** The juggernaut collapses into a large heap before quickly reforming. Each creature within 10 feet of the juggernaut must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails this saving throw is also knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
