**Tradegate Adventures**

`dice: [](tradegate-adventures-sato.md#^tradegate-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | While the characters are shopping, several hostile [xorn](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md) attack the "Trademill Mint". |
| 2 | During a demonstration for the characters, a gnome inventor's latest creation (use the [iron golem](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/iron-golem.md) stat block) runs amok, wreaking havoc. |
| 3 | Melvin Manyroads (chaotic good, gnome [mage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/mage.md)) asks the characters to help map one of the many sites in the Outlands (see the ""Other Realms"" section later in this chapter). |
| 4 | A local beekeeper wants to sell a special planar honey in the "Everything Emporium". To help her get started, the beekeeper asks the characters to capture `1d10` live [sunflies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/sunfly-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade"). |
