| dice: d6 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Restless Retiree. Gundra, an ancient dwarf, served the Solar Bastion in the field for over a century before retiring. She lives in the Solar Bastion now and relentlessly drills the knights she trains. She clearly misses working in the field. |
| 2 | Grumpy Veteran. Howart, an older human, has mentored many young adventurers, but most were smart enough to listen to his advice... unlike you lot, who seem to think you know everything. |
| 3 | Busy Supervisor. Theira, a frazzled elf, has so many irons in the fire, so many projects to keep track of! Of course you're not imposing, she says, but can you get quickly to the point, please? |
| 4 | Distracted Researcher. Haddick, a middle-aged halfling, spends most of her time in the Library Tower at the Solar Bastion. Even when she's not at the library, or when she's talking to you, it's pretty clear that her mind is still there, focused on her latest subject of research. |
| 5 | Lonely Knight. Jared, a human knight of the Solar Bastion with a distinguished career, has traveled the multiverse alone so long he's become isolated and unsure of himself in social situations. He wants to help but needs encouragement to regain his naturally friendly demeanor. |
| 6 | Hilarion. The solar speaks to you directly, via the [Sending](/Systems/5e/spells/sending.md) spell or after summoning you to the Solar Bastion. |
