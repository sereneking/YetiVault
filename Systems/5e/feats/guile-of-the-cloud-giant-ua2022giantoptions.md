# Guile of the Cloud Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: 8th-level

You've manifested the airy speech and magic emblematic of cloud giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Misty Form.** You can cast the [blur](/Systems/5e/spells/blur.md) spell without using a spell slot or material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the spell doesn't require you to maintain [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on it. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast this spell in the normal way using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat).  
- **Silver Tongue.** You gain proficiency in either the [Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception) or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using this skill.
