# Storm Boomerang
*Ranged Weapon, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 1d4 B
- **Range**: 60/120

This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from [griffon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) bone and etched with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals `1d4` bludgeoning damage and `3d4` thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower's hand.

Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node.
