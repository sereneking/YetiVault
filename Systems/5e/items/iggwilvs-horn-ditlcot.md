# Iggwilv's Horn
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


You can use an action to blow this horn to cast one of the following spells from it: [Arms of Hadar](/Systems/5e/spells/arms-of-hadar.md), [Fog Cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md), [Gust of Wind](/Systems/5e/spells/gust-of-wind.md), or [Web](/Systems/5e/spells/web.md). If the spell requires a saving throw, the spell save DC is 13.

Once the horn has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn.
