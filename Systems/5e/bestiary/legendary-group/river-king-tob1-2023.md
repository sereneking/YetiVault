# River King

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the River King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the River King can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Flash Flooding.** The fey river swells and rushes over the land, or the walls of the Hall buckle and allow the torrent in. A 60-foot line of water that is 10 feet wide rushes from a point on a wall the River King can see within 60 feet of him. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away from the point on the wall, in the direction of the water's flow, and take 9 (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage.  
- **Invoke Drowning.** River water fills the mouth and throat of one creature the River King can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or begin suffocating. A suffocating but conscious target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any creature can take an action to force the water from the target's lungs by succeeding on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check, ending the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts until the River King uses this lair action again or until the River King dies.  
- **Imperial Impression.** The River King's commanding and elegant presence in his magnificent lair overwhelms one creature he can see within 120 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the River King until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the River King's lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Rushing Rapids.** The currents of rivers and streams within 3 miles of the lair become strong and erratic. Each creature swimming in these rivers and streams has disadvantage on Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to swim, unless it has a swimming speed.  
- **Stormy Weather.** Rain and thunderstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair, and they often build to torrential downpours that obscure vision and cause waterways to overflow their banks.  
- **Well-Stocked Waterways.** Lakes, ponds, rivers, and streams within 10 miles of the lair teem with fish and other wildlife.  

If the River King dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
