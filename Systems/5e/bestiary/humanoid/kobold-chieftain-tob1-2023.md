# Kobold Chieftain
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 245*  

*This small, draconic humanoid struts as though it were ten feet tall. It wears the gilded skull of a small dragon as a helmet, and its beady eyes gleam out through the skull's sockets. It hefts its spear and shield and lets out a blood-curdling shriek, signaling the attack*.

While most kobolds are scuttling scavengers or pathetic sycophants, a few carry a spark of draconic nobility that can't be ignored. These few forge their tribes into forces to be reckoned with, rising to the rank of chieftain. A kobold chieftain stands proud, clad in war gear of fine quality and good repair. Their weapons are tended by the tribe's tinkerers, particularly evident in their springspike shields.

## Living Legend

A kobold chieftain is more than a leader, it is a symbol of the tribe's greatness. The strongest, most cunning, most ruthless of a kobold tribe embodies their connection to the revered dragons. When a chieftain sounds the call to battle, the kobolds meld into a fearless, deadly force.

## Traits

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the chieftain hits with it (included in the attack).

***Chieftain's Presence.*** Dragons and kobolds within 30 feet of the chieftain can't be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Pack Tactics.*** The kobold chieftain has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the chieftain's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kobold chieftain has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kobold makes three Spear or Shortbow attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or 13 (`2d8 + 4`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Inspiring Shriek (Recharge after Short or Long Rest).*** The kobold chieftain shrieks a draconic battle cry. Each creature that isn't a dragonborn or kobold within 30 feet of the chieftain must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Each dragonborn and kobold within 30 feet of the chieftain is inspired for 1 minute. Whenever an inspired creature makes an attack roll or saving throw, the creature can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw.

## Reactions

***Springspike Shield.*** When the kobold chieftain is wielding its shield and is hit by a melee attack within 5 feet of it, the chieftain can fire one of its shield spikes at the attacker. The attacker takes 5 (`2d4`) piercing damage.
