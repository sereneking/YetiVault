# Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 205*  

Strange new life germinates in the Haze. These multicoloured flowers emit a hallucination-inducing pollen and overflow with contaminated nectar. They are often fatally mistaken for an eldritch lily.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While the Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary flower.

## Actions

***Contaminated Nectar.*** The Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom targets one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of contamination.

***Hypnotic Pollen (recharges on a short or long rest).*** The Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom releases a cloud of glittering pollen out to a radius of 30 feet. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), the creature is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and must use all its movement on its turns to get as close to the Hypnotic Eldritch Blossom as possible.

The effect ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

## Reactions

***Spell Reflection.*** If the hypnotic eldritch blossom makes a successful saving throw against a spell which targets only it and does not have an area of effect, or a spell attack misses it, the blossom can choose another creature (including the spellcaster) it can see within 30 feet of it. The spell targets the chosen creature instead of the hypnotic eldritch blossom. If the spell forces a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the spell was an attack, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature.
