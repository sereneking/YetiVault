# Hulgaz
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 169*  

Hulgaz is a devil who hails from the stinking swamps of Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells. The self-styled Tempter corrupts mortals' souls by offering them tantalizing but ruinous boons. To do so, she directs her entourage of loyal succubi and incubi to the Material Plane in search of vulnerable mortals. When they find a particularly pitiful soul, Hulgaz might visit herself, offering even greater "gifts" to her victims.

As befits a duchess from boggy Minauros, Hulgaz appears regal yet perpetually sodden, her matted hair tangled with her soggy garments. For all her majesty, Hulgaz's fiendish nature is apparent in her monstrous features: bestial claws, glossy black eyes, and a snakelike tail tipped with a poisonous spike. On the rare occasion when her social graces fail to achieve the desired result, Hulgaz turns her natural weapons on her victims.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Hulgaz fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Hulgaz has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** Hulgaz casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will**: [Charm Person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md)

**1/day**: [Teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md)

**2/day each**: [Dispel Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [Fog Cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Hulgaz makes two Claw attacks and one Intoxicating Sting attack.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Intoxicating Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or have the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition until the start of Hulgaz's next turn.

***Brimstone Vapor (Recharge 5-6).*** Hulgaz exhales a 30-foot cone of noxious, scorching-hot vapor. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature takes 31 (`7d8`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws. A target can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Hulgaz makes one Claw attack.

***Charm.*** Hulgaz uses Spellcasting to cast [Charm Person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md).

***Curdle Heart (Costs 2 Actions).*** Hulgaz sours the good feelings of her [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) victims. She chooses any number of creatures she can see who are [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by her. Each target takes 17 (`5d6`) psychic damage as the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition applied by Hulgaz ends on it.
