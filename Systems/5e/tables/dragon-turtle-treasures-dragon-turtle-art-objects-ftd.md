| 2 | A pipe organ that the dragon turtle refers to as "Bubbles," which works underwater |
| 3 | Cast-metal masks painted with the faces of rulers whose names the dragon turtle constantly misremembers |
| 4 | A zither fashioned from a conch shell, which the dragon turtle insists visitors play before granting them an audience |
| 5 | A painted egg decorated with glittering jewels |
| 6 | An ornate underwater carriage fashioned from coral and seashells, which the dragon turtle pushes back and forth like a toy |
| 7 | A sculpture depicting a knight on griffonback, whose lance the dragon turtle uses to scrape off barnacles |
| 8 | An urn engraved with a scowling dwarf's face, whose expression the dragon turtle mimics comically |
