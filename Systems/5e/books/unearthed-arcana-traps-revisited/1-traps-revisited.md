# Traps Revisited
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Traps Revisited, p. 1* 

The rules for traps in the Dungeon Master's Guide provide the basic information you need to manage traps at the game table. The material here builds on the DMG rules and provides more guidance on creating traps of your own.

Rather than focus on traps as mechanical or magical, these rules separate traps into two categories: simple traps and complex traps.

## Simple Traps

A simple trap activates and is then harmless. A hidden pit dug at the entrance of a goblin lair, a poison needle that pops from a lock, and a crossbow rigged to fire when an intruder steps on a pressure plate are all simple traps.

### Describing a Simple Trap

Simple traps require three elements to function: a trigger, an effect they have once triggered, and the measures that can defeat them. In addition, a trap is given a level and an overall description of the threat it poses.

#### Level and Threat

A trap's level is expressed as a range of levels to give you an idea of its relative strength (levels 1–4, 5–10, 11–16, and 17–20). It is then labeled as a moderate, dangerous, or deadly threat. The trap's label tells you how powerful the trap is compared to others of its level range.

#### Trigger

A simple trap has a trigger that describes what causes the trap to activate. The trigger's description includes its location and the action that causes it to activate.

#### Effect

A trap's effect describes what happens when its trigger activates. The trap might fire a dart, unleash a cloud of poison gas, cause a hidden point to open, and so on. The effect specifies who the trap targets, its attack bonus or saving throw DC, and what happens on a hit or failed saving throw.

#### Countermeasures

A trap can be defeated in a variety of ways. This section of a trap's description details the checks or spells that can detect and disable it. It also specifies what happens, if anything, on a failed attempt to disable it.

### Running a Simple Trap

When managing a simple trap in play, start by making note of the characters' passive [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception) scores. Most traps allow Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to detect their triggers or other elements that can tip off their presence. If you stop to ask for checks, the players might suspect a hidden danger.

When a trap triggers, apply its effects as specified in its description. Be sure of the players' intended actions before a trap activates so that it springs into action based on what the players want to do, rather than a course of action they're arguing about or merely considering. If the players discover a trap, be open to adjudicating their ideas for defeating it. The trap's description is a starting point for countermeasures, rather than a complete definition.

The players should be specific in how they want to defeat the trap. Simply stating the desire to make a check isn't enough. Ask the players where their characters are positioned and what they intend to do to defeat the trap. A player can't just say, "I use thieves' tools to disable it." That's too murky. The player instead should describe something like, "I use my thieves' tools to examine the lock and attempt to disable the poison needle inside it." The last thing you want is confusion over where the characters are located if a trap activates.

As a default, overcoming a simple trap offers no experience point reward. If the characters uncover the trap and avoid or disable it, their reward is dodging a threatening element of the dungeon. If they stumble into it, they must cope with the consequences of a more dangerous situation.

## Designing Simple Traps

You can create a simple trap by using the following guidelines. You can also adapt the example traps by modifying DCs and damage values, based on the target level and threat for the trap.

Purpose Before diving into the details of your trap, think about its purpose. Why would someone build this trap? What is its purpose? Think of the trap's creator, the creator's purpose, and the location that the trap protects. Traps have context in the world, and that context drives the trap's nature and effects.

Described below are a few of the purposes a trap might have. Use them to inspire the creation of your own traps.

### Alarm

An alarm trap is designed to alert an area's occupants of intruders. It might cause a bell or gong to sound. This type of trap rarely involves a saving throw.

### Delay

These traps serve to slow down intruders, giving a dungeon's inhabitants time to mount a defense or flee. A hidden pit is the classic example of this trap. A 10-foot-deep pit usually deals little damage and is easy to escape, but it slows down intruders. Other examples include collapsing walls, a portcullis that drops from the ceiling, and a locking mechanism that shuts and bars a door. These traps, when they directly threaten characters, usually require a Dexterity saving throw to avoid.

### Restrain

A restraining trap tries to keep its victims in place, leaving them unable to move. These traps are most useful when combined with a regular guard patrol, but in ancient dungeons the guards might be long gone. These traps usually require a Strength saving throw to avoid, but some don't allow saves. In addition to dealing damage, they also render a creature unable to move. A subsequent, successful Strength check (use the saving throw DC) or damage against the trap can break it and free the captive. Examples include a bear trap, a cage that drops from a ceiling, or a device that flings a net.

### Slay

These traps are designed to eliminate intruders. They include [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) needles that spring out when a lock is tampered with, blasts of fire that fill a room, poison gas, and so on. Saving throws—usually Dexterity or Constitution—allow creatures to avoid or mitigate the trap's effects.

### Level and Lethality

Before creating a trap's effects, think about its level and its lethality.

Traps are divided into four level ranges, 1st– 4th, 5th–10th, 11th–16th, and 17th–20th. A trap's level range gives you a starting point for its potency.

To further calibrate the trap's strength, pick whether it is a moderate, dangerous, or deadly threat within its level range. A moderate trap is unlikely to kill a character and is the weakest trap type. Dangerous traps deal enough damage that a character hit by one is eager for healing. A deadly trap might reduce a creature to 0 hit points in one shot, and leaves most creatures in need of a short or long rest.

Consult the following tables when nailing down a trap's effects. The Trap Save DCs and [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) Bonuses table provides guidelines for a trap's save DC, check DC, and attack bonus. The check DC is the default number used for any check used to interact with the trap.

The Damage Severity by Level table lists the typical damage a trap deals at certain character levels. The damage listed assumes the trap damages one creature. Use d6s for damage in place of d10s for traps that can affect more than one character at a time.

The Spell Equivalent by Level lists the spell slot level that is appropriate for the given character level and the danger posed by the trap. A spell is a great shortcut to use when designing a trap, whether the trap duplicates the spell (a mirror that throws charm person on whoever looks into it) or uses its effects (an alchemical device that explodes like fireball). Note that the Deadly entry for characters above 17th level suggests combining a 9th and 5th level spell into one effect. In this case, pick two spells, or combine the effects of a spell cast using a 9th-level and a 5th-level slot.

**Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses**

| Trap Danger | Save/Check DC | Attack Bonus |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| Moderate | 10 | +5 |
| Dangerous | 15 | +8 |
| Deadly | 20 | +12 |

| 11th–16th | 3rd | 6th | 9th |
| 17th–20th | 6th | 9th | 9th + 5th |

### Triggers

A trigger is the circumstance that needs to take place to activate the trap.

Decide what causes the trap to activate and determine how the characters can find the trigger. Here are some example triggers:

- a pressure plate that, when stepped on, activates the trap  
- a tripwire that springs a trap when it is broken, usually when someone walks through it  
- a doorknob that activates a trap when it is turned the wrong way  
- a door or chest that triggers a trap when it is opened  

A trigger usually needs to be hidden to be effective. Otherwise, avoiding the trap is trivially easy.

A trigger requires a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check if simply spotting it reveals its nature. The characters can foil a pit trap hidden by a leafcovered net if they spot the pit through a gap in the leaves. A tripwire is foiled if spotted, as is a pressure plate.

Other traps require careful inspection and deduction to notice. A doorknob opens a door when turned to the left, but activates a trap when turned to the right. Such a subtle trap requires a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to notice. The trigger is obvious. Understanding its nature is not.

The DC of the check, regardless of its type, depends on the skill and care taken to conceal the trap. Most traps require a DC 20 check to spot, but a poorly made or hastily built trap has a DC of 15. Exceptionally devious pitfalls might have a DC of 25.

You must then put some thought into what characters learn with a successful check. In most cases, the check reveals the trap. In other cases, it uncovers useful clues but still requires some deduction. The characters might succeed on the check but still trigger the trap if they fail to understand what they have learned.

> [!readaloud] Perception and Investigation
> 
> A Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check that reveals a tripwire doesn't tell the players what happens if they break the tripwire. They spot it before blundering into it, but must still decide what to do next. The nature of the item is not in question, but you might not spot it. A successful check reveals it.
> 
> An Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check reveals that the scuff marks and wear pattern show that a doorknob can turn both ways, but is most often turned clockwise. The players must still decide how to open the door. The item is obvious, but its true nature is obscured. A successful check reveals the clues that point to the item's purpose.
^perception-and-investigation

### Effects

Designing a trap's effects is a straightforward process. The tables for save DCs, attack bonuses, damage, and the like give you a starting point for most simple traps that deal damage.

For traps with more complex effects, your best starting point is to use the Spell Equivalent by Level table to find the best match for your trap's intended effect. Spells are a good starting point because they are compact pieces of game design that deliver specific effects.

Once you have chosen the effect the trap delivers, choose its damage, attack bonus, and save DC. If you are using a spell as a starting point, check to see if you need to tweak its effects to fit the trap's nature. For instance, you can easily change the damage type a spell delivers or the saving throw it requires.

### Disarming Simple Traps

Simple traps require a single ability check to disarm. Imagine how the trap operates, and then think about how the characters can overcome it. Not all traps can be disarmed in a traditional way. A hidden pit trap is effectively disarmed when the characters notice it. The characters can simply walk around it or climb down one side, walk across it, and climb up the other side.

Once you determine how a trap can be disarmed, pick the appropriate ability and skill combinations that characters can use. In most cases, a Dexterity check made with thieves' tools, a Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check, or an Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can overcome a trap.

A Dexterity check made with thieves' tools can apply to any trap with a mechanical element. Thieves' tools can be used to safely disable a tripwire or pressure plate, disassemble a poison needle mechanism, or stop up a valve that leaks poisonous gas into a room.

Strength checks are useful for traps that can be destroyed or held back through brute force. A scything blade can be broken, a collapsing roof held in place, a net torn apart.

Magical traps can be disabled by someone who can undermine the magic used to power them. An Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check allows a character to figure out how the trap functions and how to disable its magic. A statue that belches a jet of magical flame might be disabled when one of its glass eyes is shattered, disrupting the magic that powers it.

Finally, decide if there are any drawbacks to a failed attempt to disable the trap. If so, pick a threshold for the check result or decide that any failure activates the trap. If the result hits that threshold or lower, the trap activates. This option is a useful tool to make a trap feel dangerous even if the characters have discovered it. A trap that can be disabled without any danger is like a monster that can't fight back. Of course, use logic to guide your decisions. This element makes a trap interesting, but it shouldn't come at the cost of making your game feel illogical or arbitrary. For instance, let's say your trap is a section of floor that opens to send characters tumbling into a pit. If the rogue attempting to disarm the pit stands next to the trap, it makes no sense for the rogue to fall in if the trap activates. Of course, you can remedy this by specifying that the character must lean over the trap or have one foot on it to reach and disable the mechanism.

### Placing Simple Traps

Context is everything with traps. A log trap that knocks characters aside is an inconvenience on the typical forest path. It's a potentially deadly hazard on a narrow trail that hugs the side of a towering cliff face.

Chokepoints and narrow passages that lead to important places in a dungeon are a good spot for traps, especially those traps that serve as alarms or restraints. These traps foil intruders before they can reach a critical location, giving the dungeon's denizens a chance to mount a defense.

Treasure chests, doors to vaults, and any other barrier or container that holds a valuable treasure is the ideal location for a slaying trap. In this case, the trap is the final line of defense that can eliminate a thief or intruder.

Alarm traps, since they pose no direct physical threat, are ideal for areas that are used by a dungeon's denizens. If a stumbling goblin activates an alarm trap, there's no real harm done. The alarm sounds, the guards arrive, they berate the clumsy goblin, and then they reset the trap. Of course, an alarm trap that is triggered on accident too often might fail to generate a quick response from defenders.

Above all else, place traps logically and with consideration to the time and effort needed to make them. If your adventures are sown with too many traps, the game grinds to a halt as the players search every square inch of a dungeon for tripwires and pressure plates.

It's all right if the players correctly deduce a trap's presence. That means your trap was placed logically and the players are engaged with the game.

## Complex Traps

A complex trap poses multiple dangers to adventurers. Once a complex trap activates, it remains dangerous round after round until the characters avoid it or disable it. Some complex traps grow more dangerous over time, as they gather power or gain speed.

Complex traps are also more difficult to disable than simple ones. A single check is not enough to disable one. Instead, a series of checks is required to slowly disable each component. The trap degrades with each ch eck until the characters finally deactivate it. Most complex traps are designed so that they can be disarmed only if you are willing to risk the trap's effects. For example, in a hallway filled with scything blades, the mechanism that controls them is on the opposite end from the entrance, or a statue that bathes an area in necrotic energy can only be disabled while standing in the zone of energy it emits.

### Describing a Complex Trap

Complex traps build on the four parts of a simple trap, adding in elements that make the trap a more dynamic threat.

#### Level and Threat

A complex trap uses the same level bands and ratings for its lethality as a simple trap does.

#### Trigger

Just like a simple trap, a complex one has a trigger. Some complex traps have multiple triggers.

#### Initiative

A complex trap takes turns like a creature does. Complex traps are slow (initiative 10), fast (initiative 20), or very fast (initiative 20 and 10).

#### Active Elements

On a trap's turn, it activates specific effects that are detailed in its description. The trap might have multiple active elements, a table you roll on to determine its effect at random, or options for you to choose from.

#### Dynamic Elements

Many complex traps feature a changing threat. The trap's description tells you how the trap changes over time. Usually, these changes take effect at the end of each of its turns or in response to the characters' actions.

#### Constant Elements

A complex trap poses a threat even when it is not its turn. The constant elements describe how these parts of the trap function. Most make an attack or force a saving throw against creatures that end their turns within certain areas.

#### Countermeasures

A trap can be defeated in a variety of ways. A trap's description details the checks or spells that can detect and disable it. It also specifies what happens, if anything, on a failed attempt to disable it.

Disabling a complex trap is like disarming a simple trap, except that a complex trap requires more checks. It typically takes three successful checks to disable one of a complex trap's elements. Many of these traps have multiple elements, requiring a lot of work to shut down every part of the trap. Usually, a successful check reduces a trap element's effectiveness if it doesn't disable it.

### Running a Complex Trap

A complex trap functions in play like a legendary monster. When activated, the trap's active elements act on either initiative 20 or 10 (or both, for very fast traps). On that initiative count, after all creatures with that same initiative have acted, the trap's features activate. Apply the effects detailed in the trap's description.

After resolving the effects of the trap's active elements, check its dynamic elements to see if anything changes about the trap. Many complex traps have effects that vary over the course of an encounter. A magical aura might do more damage the longer it is active, or a swinging blade might shift which area of a chamber it attacks.

The trap's constant elements allow it to have effects when it isn't the trap's turn. At the end of each creature's turn, look at the trap's constant elements to see if any of its effects trigger.

## Example Complex Traps

Here are examples of complex traps to inspire your own creations.

- [Path of Blades](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/path-of-blades-uatrapsrevisited.md)  
- [Sphere of Crushing Doom](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/sphere-of-crushing-doom-uatrapsrevisited.md)  
- [Poisoned Tempest](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/poisoned-tempest-uatrapsrevisited.md)  

## Designing Complex Traps

Creating a complex trap takes more work than building a simple one, but with some practice you can learn the process and make it move quickly.

Familiarize yourself with the guidelines on designing a simple trap before proceeding with these guidelines on complex ones.

### Purpose

Complex traps are typically designed to protect an area by killing or disabling intruders. It is worth your time to consider who made the trap, the trap's purpose, and its desired result. Does the trap protect a treasure? Does it target only certain intruders? Use the advice given for simple traps as a starting point.

### Level and Lethality

Complex traps use the same level bands and lethality ratings as simple traps. Refer back to that section for a discussion of how level and lethality help determine save and check DCs, attacks bonuses, and other numerical elements of a complex trap.

### Map

A complex trap has multiple parts, typically relies on the characters' positions to resolve some of its effects, and can bring several effects to bear each round. The traps are called complex for a reason! To make design easier, draw a map of the area affected by the trap using 5 feet for each square on your graph paper. This level of detail allows you to develop a clear idea of what the trap can do and how each of its parts interact. Your map is the starting point and context for the rest of the trap-design process.

Don't limit yourself to one room. Look at the passages and rooms around the area of the trap and think about the role they can play. The trap might cause doors to lock and gates to fall into place to prevent escape. It could cause darts to fire from the walls in one area, forcing characters to enter rooms where other devices trigger and threaten them.

Consider how terrain and furniture can add to the trap's danger. A chasm or pit might create the distance that allows a trap to send bolts of magic at the characters while making it difficult or even impossible to reach the runes the party must deface to foil it.

Think of your map like a script. Where do the characters want to go? What does the trap protect? How can the characters get there? What are their likely escape routes? Answering those questions tells you where the trap's various elements should be placed.

### Active Elements

A complex trap's active elements work the same way as a simple trap's effects, except that a complex trap activates every round. Otherwise, the guidelines for picking save DCs, attack bonuses, and damage are the same. To make your trap logically consistent, make sure the elements you design can activate each round. For instance, crossbows rigged to fire at the characters need a mechanism to reload them.

In terms of lethality, it's better to have multiple dangerous effects in a trap than a single deadly one. As a rule of thumb, build your trap with two dangerous trap elements and one moderate one.

It's useful to create multiple active elements, each affecting a different area covered by the trap. It is also a good idea to use a variety of effects. Some parts of the trap might cause damage, and others might immobilize characters or isolate them from the rest of the party. Think about how the elements can work together. A bashing lever might knock characters into the area engulfed by jets of flame.

### Constant Elements

In addition to the active steps a complex trap takes, it should also present a continual hazard. Often, the active and constant effects are the same thing. Imagine a hallway filled with whirling saw blades. On the trap's turn, the blades attack anyone in the hall. In addition, anyone who lingers in the hallway takes damage at the end of each of their turns, representing the constant threat the blades pose.

A constant element should apply its effect to any character who ends their turn in that element's area. If an active element presents a threat when it isn't its turn, determine the threat it poses as a constant element. As a rule of thumb, keep the saving throw DC or attack bonus the same but reduce the damage by half.

Avoid filling the entire encounter area with constant elements. Part of the puzzle of a complex trap lies in figuring out which areas are safe. A moment's respite can help add an element of pacing to a complex trap and give the characters the feeling that they aren't in constant peril. For example, walls that slam together might need to reset between slams, leaving them harmless when it isn't their turn.

### Dynamic Elements

Just as a battle is more interesting if the monsters change their tactics or unveil new abilities in later rounds, so too are complex traps more fun if their nature changes in some way. The whirling blades that protect a treasure chest do more damage each round, as they speed up. The poison gas in a room grows thicker as more of it floods the chamber, dealing more damage and blocking line of sight. The necrotic aura around an idol of Demogorgon produces random effects each time it triggers its active effect. As water floods a chamber, the characters must swim across areas they could walk through just a round or two before.

Since complex traps remain active over the course of several rounds, they can pose an ongoing threat to intruders. However, if that threat becomes predictable its victims have a much better chance of thwarting it. Complex traps work best when they present multiple threats to intruders, ones that can change each round. The changes can include how a trap targets the characters (attack or even type of saving throw), the damage or effects it deals, the areas it covers, and so on. Some traps might have a random effect each round, while others follow a carefully programmed sequence of attacks designed to frustrate and slay intruders.

Dynamic elements can occur on schedule. For a room that floods, you can plan out how the rising water level affects the area each round. The water might be ankle deep at the end of the first round, knee deep the next, and so on. Not only does the water carry a drowning risk, but it also makes it harder to move across the area; however, the rising water level might allow characters to swim to the upper reaches of the chamber that they couldn't reach from the floor.

Dynamic elements can also come into play in reaction to the characters' actions. Disarming one element of the trap might make the others deadlier. Disabling a rune that triggers a firebreathing statue might cause the statue to explode, as the magic in it runs rampant. If a creature dies in the room, the idol to the god Nerull drains its soul and gains a new power.

A trap's dynamic elements also make for a good timer. For example, the damage dealt by poison gas in a room starts at 11, but doubles each time the trap takes its turn. Smart players see that they only have a few rounds to overcome the trap before they must flee or risk death.

Random dynamic elements are fun because they keep the players on their toes and make any plan made to foil it dependent on the luck of the dice. In this case, you create a table and roll on it to see how the trap changes. The players can never be sure what might happen next. As a rule of thumb, one random element for a complex trap is a good limit. A trap that is too random can feel arbitrary and frustrating. You want to make planning harder, not impossible.

The dynamic elements should change after the trap's turn. The water level rises after the trap's active element takes its turn. The blades speed up and deal an additional die of damage each time they miss a character, their damage returning to its starting point after the impact of a successful attack causes them to slow down.

### Triggers

The advice on triggers given for simple traps applies to complex ones, with one exception. Complex traps feature multiple triggers, or are designed such that avoiding a trigger prevents intruders from reaching the area the trap guards. Other complex traps use magical triggers that activate on specific cues, such as when a door opens or someone enters an area without wearing the correct badge, amulet, or robe.

Look at your map and consider when you want the trap to spring into action. It's best to have a complex trap trigger after the characters have committed to exploring an area. A simple trap might trigger when the characters open a door. A complex one that triggers that early leaves the PCs looking into the trapped room and perhaps opting to close the door and move on. A simple trap aims to keep intruders out. A complex trap wants to lure them in, so that when it activates, the intruders must deal with it to escape.

In general, the trigger for a complex trap should be as foolproof as you can make it. A complex trap represents a serious expenditure of effort and magical power. No one builds one and makes it easy to avoid. Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) and Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) checks might be unable to spot a trigger, especially a magical one, but they can still give hints about the trap before it triggers. Blood stains, ashes, gouges in the floor, and so on can point to the trap's effects and give a warning.

### Initiative

A complex trap acts repeatedly, requiring you to note its initiative. Unlike characters and monsters, traps don't roll for initiative. As mechanical or magical devices, they operate in a predictable manner. When designing a complex trap, you must first decide how often it activates. Complex traps fall into three categories: slow, fast, and very fast.

#### Slow

These traps take time to build up their effects. Their active elements take place on initiative 10. This option is good for a trap that works alongside monsters or other guardians, as it can give guards the chance to move out of its active areas or force characters into them before triggering.

#### Fast

These traps are designed to surprise intruders and hit them before they can react. Such a trap acts on initiative 20. This setting is your best option for a complex trap. Think of it as the default approach. It acts quickly enough to surprise slower characters, with fast characters like rogues, rangers, and monks having the best chance to move out of the trap before it activates.

#### Very Fast

These traps are a blur of activity, laying waste to intruders in a few moments unless countered. They act on both initiative 20 and 10. These traps should feature multiple active elements, with different elements acting on different initiative counts. Use this option for a trap that can benefit by having its elements work in concert. For instance, on initiative 20 blades sweep across a treasure vault, driving the characters back into the hallway. On initiative 10, magical darts fire from statues in the hallway while a gate falls to trap the characters.

> [!readaloud] Complex Traps and Legendary Monsters
> 
> A complex trap is like a legendary monster in some ways. It has several tricks it can use on its turn. It remains a threat throughout the round, not just on its turn. The trap's active elements are like a legendary creature's normal actions, and its constant elements are equivalent to legendary actions (except they are tied to specific areas in the trapped room).
> 
> While a legendary creature can move, improvise actions, and so forth, a trap is set to a specific script, with the potential to make a complex trap stale. That's where dynamic elements come in.

### Defeating Complex Traps

A complex trap is never defeated with a single check. Instead, each successful check foils some part of it or degrades its performance. Each element of the trap must be overcome individually to foil the trap as a whole.

To start with, look at your map and consider where the characters must be located to attempt an action that can foil part of the trap. Most trap designers count on the trap to protect itself. A fighter might be able to break a whirling blade, but moving close enough to attack it requires giving the blade a chance to strike.

Consider how the trap can be overcome. Obvious candidates are the same sorts of checks used to defeat simple traps, but use your understanding of the trap's design to keep other options open, too. A valve leaking poison gas into a room can be stopped up. A statue emitting a deadly aura can be pushed over and smashed. Attacks, spells, and special abilities can all play a role in undermining a trap.

Leave room for improvisation. If you understand the mechanism behind how a trap works, it makes it much easier for you to handle the players' ideas. Don't create a few solutions and wait for the players to guess the exact, right approach. Like everything in D&D, pick an ability, assess the chance of success, and ask for a roll.

Aim at requiring three successful checks or actions to shut down one part of a trap. The first successful check might reduce the trap component's save DC or attack bonus by 4. The second successful one might halve its damage. The final successful check might shut it down.

For trap components that don't attack, allow each check to reduce that element's effectiveness by one-third. A lock's DC is reduced or a gate opens wide enough to allow a Small character to squeeze through it. A mechanism pumping poison gas into the room slows down, causing the gas's damage to increase slowly or not at all.

It takes time to work on a trap. Three characters can't make checks right after one another to disarm it in 6 seconds. They would get in each other's way and disrupt their efforts. Once a character succeeds on a check, another character can't attempt the same check to disable the same trap element until the end of the successful character's next turn.

Not all of the characters' options must be focused on stopping a trap. Think of what characters can do to mitigate or avoid a trap's effects. This approach is a good way to make characters who might be ill -suited to disarm a trap feel useful. An Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check might reveal the pattern a swinging blade follows, giving disadvantage on its attack rolls until the start of the character's next turn. A character with a shield can stand in front of a dart trap, making themself a target each time other characters trigger it.
