# Spiderfrog
*Source: Muk's Guide To Everything He Learned From Tasha p. 33*  

Spiderfrogs are unique to the Dankwood and may or may not have been created by the eccentric gnome wizard, Doonwaggle. Either way, their high-pitched squeaking sounds indicate that they are thriving in large numbers, despite being difficult to catch.

If you are lucky enough to come across an abandoned spiderfrog egg, raising one kindly will gift you the most helpful house-mate. Spiderfrogs are excellent at getting rid of pests and neatly pack away their webs at night, as they prefer to sleep under the shelter of a big, juicy leaf.
