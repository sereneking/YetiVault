**Major Adaptations**

`dice: [](major-adaptations-ggr.md#^major-adaptations)`

| dice: d8 | Major Adaptation |
|----------|------------------|
| 1 | Acidic Skin. Any creature that touches the krasis or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage (category 1), 4 (1d8) acid damage (category 2), or 6 (1d12) acid damage (category 3). |
| 2 | Armored Hide. The krasis has better natural armor afforded by a shell or thick scales, increasing its Armor Class by 4. |
| 3 | Bioluminescent Markings. The krasis has glowing patterns on its skin that take the shape of defensive runes, granting it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. |
| 4 | Flight. The krasis has wings and gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed. |
| 5 | Grabber. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13 for category 1, DC 15 for category 2, and DC 19 for category 3) by a specialized grasping appendage on the krasis. It can have only one creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way at a time. |
| 6 | Hypnotic Display (Recharge 5-6). As an action, the krasis creates mesmerizing colors and shapes around itself. Each creature within 15 feet of it that can see it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. The [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw against this effect becomes immune to the Hypnotic Display of all krasis for 24 hours. |
| 7 | Venomous Sting. When the krasis hits a creature with its claws, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 12 for category 1, DC 14 for category 2, and DC 18 for category 3) or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. If the krasis is a category 2 or 3, the creature is [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. |
| 8 | Regeneration. The krasis regains hit points (2 for a category 1, 5 for a category 2, and 10 for a category 3) at the start of each of its turns if it has at least 1 hit point. |
