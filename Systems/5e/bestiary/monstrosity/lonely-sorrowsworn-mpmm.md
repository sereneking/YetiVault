# Lonely Sorrowsworn
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 223, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 232, Vecna: Eve of Ruin*  

The sorrow of isolation afflicts many creatures that lurk in the Shadowfell, but the need for companionship is never manifested more dramatically than in the lonely sorrowsworn—also called the Lonely. When these sorrowsworn spot other creatures, they feel keenly the need for interaction and launch their harpoon-like arms to drag their victims closer.

## Sorrowsworn

The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature. Sorrowsworn embody the forms of suffering inherent to the shadowy landscape and visit horror on those who stumble into their midst. Each sorrowsworn personifies a different aspect of despair or distress.

The sorrowsworn has two harpoon arms and can grapple up to two creatures at once.

***Sorrowful Embrace.*** Each creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the sorrowsworn must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the sorrowsworn pulls each of those creatures up to 30 feet straight toward it.
