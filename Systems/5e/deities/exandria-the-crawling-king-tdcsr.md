- **Alternate Names**: Torog
- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Category**: Betrayer Gods

- **Symbol**: A circular copper holy symbol with a black void in the centre and three twisted pale hands extending from the void.

The god of the endless tunnels and caverns beneath Exandria, the Crawling King is patron to torturers, slavers, and jailers across the realms. The furious, molten tears he wept upon his defeat carved a network of infinite subterranean pathways beneath Exandriaâ€”and in the vastness of the Outer Planes, his plane of imprisonment is a realm of logic-defying caves and grasping manacles from which few return alive.

Those who rob others of their freedom offer prayers to him in cellars and other subterranean domains, and other creatures who live in the darkness below worship him and seek his guidance.

## Depiction

The Crawling King is rendered as a swollen, malformed worm that slithers through the dark below, with a screaming, hairless human head and three arms carving through the lightless rock.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Crawling King's clerics are granted powers of Death or Trickery.

## Enemies

The Dawnfather and the Everlight defeated the Crawling King during the "Calamity" by luring their nemesis above ground. The Dawnfather pierced his tenebrous body with ten thousand lances of sunlight, and the Everlight imprisoned him beyond the boundaries of Exandria within her serene rays. The tears of pain and anger the Crawling King shed burned through Exandria, and his faithful fled into these tunnels to escape their enemies' holy light.

- Seek and exalt places where no light touches.  
- Revel in the pain you inflict upon others, and relish the pain you suffer yourself as an offering to the Crawling King.  
- Imprison those who cannot resist you, and drag all life into the darkness.
