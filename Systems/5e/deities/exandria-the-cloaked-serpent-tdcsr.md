A wanderer in the shadows and the creator of snakes and serpentkin, the Cloaked Serpent is the evil god of poisons, assassins, and darkness. The ancient serpentkin worship him over all other deities, dragging screaming offerings to their temples in his honor. Most of the Cloaked Serpent's worshipers were annihilated during the "Calamity", and those that weren't are either suspended in self-induced stasis or hunted for sport by the servants of the Spider Queen and the Crawling King. But perhaps the Cloaked Serpent is merely biding his time, waiting for the proper moment to unleash his hidden armies upon the world once more.

In Tal'Dorei, most of the Cloaked Serpent's serpentkin followers live in arcane suspension on the mysterious "Visa Isle".

## Depiction

Many forgotten temples were once built to worship the Cloaked Serpent, and his image was embedded within much of their architecture. He possesses a humanoid body with six arms and a fanged, serpentine head adorned with a threatening hood. Strands of thick, dark hair sprout from his scaled body, obscuring his form in layers of swirling shadow.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Cloaked Serpent's clerics are granted powers of Nature or Trickery.

## Enemies

The Cloaked Serpent loathes the Lawbearer and the Wildmother, for he despises life, order, and love above all things. His surviving worshipers relish in using poison and fire to consume nature and undermine civilization, hoping to infuriate both goddesses and cast Exandria into chaos.

- Keep your acts obfuscated and secret. The night is your greatest ally.  
- Strike quickly and without reason. Blind the target with their own confusion.  
- Kill slowly. Agonizingly. Or worse, make them enjoy it.
