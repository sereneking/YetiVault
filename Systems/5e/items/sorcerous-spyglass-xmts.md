# Sorcerous Spyglass
*Wondrous Item, unknown (magic)*  


This elegant brass [spyglass](/Systems/5e/items/spyglass.md) features an intricate lens mechanism. A creature looking through the sorcerous spyglass has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to detect things that can be seen. In addition, the user can view magical auras while looking through the spyglass, as if under the effect of a [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) spell.
