## Traits

### Githzerai Psionics

You know the [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip, and the hand is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) when you cast the cantrip with this trait.

Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [shield](/Systems/5e/spells/shield.md) spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell with it. Once you cast [shield](/Systems/5e/spells/shield.md) or [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race). None of these spells require spell components when you cast them with this trait.

### Mental Discipline

Your innate psychic defenses grant you advantage on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) and [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) conditions on yourself.

### Psychic Resilience

You have resistance to psychic damage.

## Description

Githzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos. As the ages passed, githzerai explorers ranged out to other planes and worlds of the multiverse.

Githzerai are generally slender, with speckled skin in shades of yellow, green, or brown. Eons of cultivating their mental powers within the endless chaos of Limbo have imbued githzerai with the ability to shape psionic energy to protect themselves and probe minds.
