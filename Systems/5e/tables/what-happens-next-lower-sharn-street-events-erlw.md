`dice: [](what-happens-next-lower-sharn-street-events-erlw.md#^lower-sharn-street-events)`

| dice: d100 | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 01–02 | A [minotaur](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/minotaur.md) holding a large piece of wood that could serve as a maul approaches you and politely asks if you have any copper to spare. |
| 03–04 | Down a nearby alleyway, a dwarf punches a [goblin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) in the stomach, then walks away laughing. |
| 05–08 | A thin human child has been following you, but never gets too close. She keeps coughing, and you can see red marks on her neck that might be an aberrant dragonmark. |
| 09–10 | A human [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) of Boldrei wheels a cart of bread loaves through the city, giving food to the homeless. |
| 11–15 | A [goblin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) pushing a cart of rusty weapons and broken clay pots calls out, "Real artifacts of ancient Dhakaan for sale! Recovered from the ruins below!" |
| 16–18 | A man dressed in the livery of House Vadalis descends a tower wall mounted on the back of a [giant spider](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md). He shouts, "Need a ride? No faster way to get to the middle and upper wards! Reasonable rates!" |
| 19–22 | An [ogre](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/ogre.md) eating several rats on a skewer spits out a rodent skull at your feet. |
| 23–26 | A playful stray [mastiff](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/mastiff.md) wags its tail as it approaches, drops a very large egg at your feet, and looks up expectantly. |
| 27–30 | A small, jovial crowd gathers around a [goblin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) and a [kobold](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) that are getting ready to have an arm wrestling match. A dwarf calls for the crowd to place their bets. |
| 31–34 | Three [harpies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/harpy.md) fly through the streets singing a jolly drinking song. Each carries a bucket around her neck, and passersby occasionally drop coins in one. |
| 35–38 | A human woman and a warforged with a silvered body are walking down the street together. They're too well dressed for this district, and are looking around as if lost. |
| 39–42 | A Khoravar half-elf in the robes of an oracle approaches and promises to give you the answer to all of life's problems for 42 copper crowns. |
| 43–44 | A human and an elf kiss passionately in an alley near your path. They notice you and quickly move apart. |
| 45–46 | Three shifter children run by you, yelling and chasing each other with wooden swords. They duck into a boarded-up building. |
| 47–48 | "Stop her! She stole my necklace!" a priest of the Sovereign Host cries, pointing to a grimy halfling clutching a silver chain and climbing up the side of a tower. |
| 49–50 | A young woman using a crutch and missing a leg approaches, asking if you can spare any coin to help a Brelish veteran of the Last War. |
| 51–52 | Cries of alarm fill the street as a wooden crate from somewhere above crashes down into the lower city. |
| 53–56 | A splash of unidentified, putrid liquid falls from above, soaking you. |
| 57–60 | The generally unpleasant smell of the lower wards is pierced by the scent of something delicious being baked nearby. |
| 61–62 | A gnome sits at a table with a sign attached to it that reads, "I say Breland would have won the Last War. Change my mind." |
| 63–64 | Two [changelings](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/changeling-erlw.md) sit on a bench in front of a tavern, sharing a flask. They take turns changing their forms into the people who enter and exit the building. |
| 65–66 | A human woman shouts at a group of Cyran refugees, "Go home! Stop taking our jobs. Let the Mournland have you!" |
| 67–68 | A group of students from Morgrave University moves through the street, asking for directions to Dragoneyes. |
| 69–72 | You turn down an empty street. A door suddenly materializes on a nearby building that previously showed no entrances. |
| 73–74 | Faded graffiti on a wall reads, "Need someone knifed? Tarkanan's got you covered!" |
| 75–76 | A crowd gathers around a [kobold](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kobold.md) playing a pan flute and leading a group of rats in a merry dance. |
| 77–80 | Four [orcs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/orc.md) jab at an [ochre jelly](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md) with long staffs, trying to herd the ooze into the sewers. |
| 81–82 | Several Cyran refugees are gathered in a circle, singing a haunting song. |
| 83–84 | An old [goblin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) offers to pierce your ears or nose for 5 copper crowns. She claims, "It will be painless. I know magic!" |
| 85–86 | A figure in red robes preaches, "The Last War was not the last! As long as the monarchy rules in Breland, another war is inevitable. Rise up!" |
| 87–90 | A member of the Sharn Watch looks uncomfortable as she wanders the street. It's clear she doesn't come down here often. |
| 91–92 | Two humans run into an alley, drawing daggers as they go. |
| 93–94 | Two drunken humans exit a tavern singing a Karrnathi battle hymn. Another human shouts at them to "shut up or get shut up." The drunken pair sings louder in response. |
| 95–96 | Two children reeking of sewage argue over who gets to wear a shiny helmet that sits on the ground between them. |
| 97–00 | You find a pamphlet on the ground advertising the Silvermist Theater. Someone has scrawled on it, "The real party is in the basement." |
