# Demon Lord Mechuiti

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mechuiti takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Mechuiti can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Searing Torment.** The pain of all creatures other than demons within 120 feet of Mechuiti is intensified. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each time a creature within 120 feet of Mechuiti takes damage, it must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.  
- **Split the Earth.** A small fissure of lava opens beneath one creature Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of him. The target must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  
- **Toxic Gases.** Volcanic gases form a cloud in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Mechuiti can see within 120 feet of him. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, a creature is incapacitated.  
- **Tremor.** The whole volcano trembles and shakes. Each creature that isn't a demon and that is on a solid surface must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. All ground in the volcano becomes difficult terrain for creatures that aren't demons until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Mechuiti's lair is warped by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Dream Calling.** When a creature with an Intelligence score of 10 or higher sleeps within 3 miles of the lair, it dreams of Mechuiti. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw when it wakes or be compelled to seek out Mechuiti's cult.  
- **Pyroclastic Venting.** Mechuiti can make the volcano erupt no more than every 7 days. When he does, a cloud of hot ashes and smoke covers the area within 6 miles of the volcano, and magma flows from the volcano's cone.  
- **Unpotable Water.** Water within 1 mile of the lair carries disease. A creature that isn't a demon or behtu that drinks the water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected with a disease and be poisoned until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hp maximum by 5 (`2d4`) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.  

If Mechuiti dies, these effects fade immediately.
