# Shield of Far Sight
*Shield, rare*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) can see through the shield's eye, which has [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.

If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) that created it is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for `2d12` hours.
