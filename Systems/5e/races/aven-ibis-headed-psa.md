# Aven (Ibis-Headed)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 16*  

- **Ability Scores**: Intelligence +1
- **Size**: Medium
- **Speed**: walk: 25 ft.; fly: 30 ft.

## Traits

### Age

Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can theoretically live into their 80s. Of course, most find a glorious (or inglorious) death long before that point.

### Alignment

Most aven lean toward some form of neutrality. Ibis-headed aven, focused more on knowledge than any other virtue, are usually neutral. Hawk-headed aven are inclined toward lawful neutral.

### Size

Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

### Flight

You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for encumbrance, you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.) 

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

### Kefnet's Blessing

You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any Intelligence check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Description

A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledgeâ€”not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.

Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, along with birdlike wings and heads. Two distinct varieties of aven are found in Naktamun. One has the head of a hawk or similar bird of prey, with short wings allowing fast flight. The other variety has the head of an ibis atop a long neck, with wide, angular wings better suited to soaring. All aven have lean bodies with feathers extending from their heads down to their shoulders.

Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents. They love soaring through the sky as well, though the Hekma limits their altitude. Like all people of Naktamun, they are grateful for the Hekma's protective magic, of course. But they keenly anticipate the hour when the God-Pharaoh will return and dissolve the veil, letting them fly without limit in the afterlife.

### Combat Classes

Spellcasters are common among [ibis-headed aven](/Systems/5e/races/aven-ibis-headed-psa.md) drawn to follow the teachings of Kefnet. Their physical resemblance to the god of knowledge is reflected in the metal discipline, focus, and confidence for which aven spellcasters are known. They wield magic of air, wind, and sometimes water to buffet their foes, enhance their own flight, and counter enemy attacks. Hawk-headed aven who follow the path of the mage are more likely to learn sand-based magic that can cloud the air, blast their foes, or bury enemies in living dunes.

[Hawk-headed aven](/Systems/5e/races/aven-hawk-headed-psa.md) are often drawn to master techniques of long-range combat, whether the [javelin](/Systems/5e/items/javelin.md) that is the preferred weapon of many, the bow, or other thrown weapons. Whatever weapon they use, aven hover and swoop in the air above the fray, seeking the opportune moment to strike in exactly the right place. In line with the teachings of the god of solidarity, they often fly in tight formations with other aven in their crops, supporting and protecting each other. Aven take great pride in the precision of their attacks, relying on their keen vision and superior vantage points. They view the sharp tip of a [javelin](/Systems/5e/items/javelin.md) or [arrow](/Systems/5e/items/arrow.md) as a symbol of their love for precision, and some initiates maintain carefully tended collections of spearheads or arrowheads.

A relatively small number of aven of both varieties end up focusing on hand-to-hand combat. Even there, they use their ability to fly to great advantage, often swooping down on their foes from a great height. The speed and power of a blow from a diving aven can be utterly devastating, but such a strike poses a tremendous risk to the aven as well as the target. An aven who fails to pull up from the dive in time can suffer even worse injuries than the target of the attack. Aven often minimize this risk by hurling [javelins](/Systems/5e/items/javelin.md) while they dive, then pulling up early after a successful throw.
