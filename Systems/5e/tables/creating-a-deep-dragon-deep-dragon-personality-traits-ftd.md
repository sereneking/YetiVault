**Deep Dragon Personality Traits**

`dice: [](creating-a-deep-dragon-deep-dragon-personality-traits-ftd.md#^deep-dragon-personality-traits)`

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I will not risk injury at the hands of weaker creatures—especially while I can turn them against one another and have them fight in my stead. |
| 2 | It is difficult for anyone not of dragonkind to penetrate the twisting labyrinth of my thoughts. |
| 3 | I might disagree with other dragons, but we are superior beings and should not lower ourselves to direct conflict. |
| 4 | I have no interest in going to the surface world. It's where one sends one's servants. |
| 5 | While the petty squabbles of other creatures bore and irritate me, I might hear out those who demonstrate an appreciation for the finer things in life by bringing me delicacies like clams or [aboleth](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) flesh. |
| 6 | I might be willing to exert myself to take out a [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md). Those disgusting creatures must be stopped. |
| 7 | I dream of seeing the deepest places in the ocean. |
| 8 | I find I rather enjoy the company of people—as long as they remain unaware of my true nature. |
