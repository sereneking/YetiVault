# Trip Attack
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 3*  

When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. Roll the die, and add it to the attack's damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must also succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
