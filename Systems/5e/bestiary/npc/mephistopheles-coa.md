# Mephistopheles
*Source: Chains of Asmodeus p. 223*  

Mephistopheles is the lord of Cania, the eighth level of the Nine Hells, and the most formidable archdevil next to Asmodeus himself. He is famed as Hell's most powerful spellcaster and the wielder of a power known as Hellfire.

An ancient entity, rivaling Asmodeus in age, Mephistopheles has been responsible for many schemes to try and unseat the Lord of the Nine Hells. One of his most infamous was an alliance between himself, Dispater, Mammon, and Geryon. They conspired to take power from the other archdevils, Baalzebul, Zariel, Belial, and Moloch. With this increased power, Mephistopheles believed he could challenge Asmodeus himself. But he was betrayed by Geryon, who had secretly sided with Asmodeus. Despite the blatancy of his rebellion, Mephistopheles was the archdevil that suffered the least: not cursed like Mammon or Baalzebul; not cast down like Belial, Moloch or Geryon. This has led many to believe that there is some ancient secret to the relationship between Asmodeus and Mephistopheles, though what it could be is a mystery none have discovered.

As the foremost spellcaster of the Nine Hells, Mephistopheles often resorts to magic when forced to defend himself. But his greatest power comes from the ability to wield Hellfire itself. Created by tapping into the profane essence of the Nine Hells, Hellfire is unimaginably, unbearably hot. Mephistopheles can also shape Hellfire however he wishes, making it his most potent weapon.

## Mephistopheles' Lair

This archdevil's lair is the Citadel of Mephistar, located within the glacier of Nargus. This an elegantly carved ice palace and is home to Mephistopheles' private manor, along with living accommodations for numerous other devils.

## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Mephistopheles' darkvision.

***Fiendish Regeneration.*** Mephistopheles regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes radiant damage this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. Mephistopheles only dies if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and is unable to regenerate.
