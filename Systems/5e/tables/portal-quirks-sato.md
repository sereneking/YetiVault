**Portal Quirks**

`dice: [](portal-quirks-sato.md#^portal-quirks)`

| dice: d6 | Portal Quirk |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | One-Way. The portal functions only one way, either into or out of Sigil. The portal isn't visible or detectable from the exit side. |
| 2 | Shifting. One end of the portal moves in a pattern between different locations in Sigil or the destination plane. |
| 3 | Slow. After a creature enters the portal, `2d4` days pass before the creature appears at its destination, during which time the creature is trapped in a stasis and is unaware of the passage of time. |
| 4 | Taxing. The portal's energy is unstable. A creature that passes through the portal must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). |
| 5 | Temporary. The portal allows only `1d6 + 6` travelers to pass through in either direction, then vanishes. |
| 6 | Tumbling Lock. Every time the portal is opened, it requires a different portal key. |
