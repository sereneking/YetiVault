| 1 | Locals weave flowers into crowns and sew cuts of meat into cloaks, creating traditional garb for an upcoming festival. |
| 2 | Most children in town are hexbloods (see "chapter 1"). Evasive locals refuse to say why. |
| 3 | Villagers harvest wings and chrysalises from caged moths, which are powdered and used to make "shift spice"â€”a pervasive ingredient in local dishes. |
| 4 | A group of young people dramatically sob at the window of an old woman, who tosses horned wicker dolls to those who sob loudest. |
| 5 | A local fisher teaches knife-wielding youngsters how to debone live eels and create festive "elver-crowns," a grim local decoration. |
| 6 | With adult approval, youngsters affix hornlike sticks to a terrified animal's head. |
| 7 | A lovingly carved door or mural depicts a woman's face made of moth wings, watching over an explicitly detailed scene of butchery or surgery. |
| 8 | Villagers sing and dance in a circle around someone undergoing a ritual to have their left eye removed. |
