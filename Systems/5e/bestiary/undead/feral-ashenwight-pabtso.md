# Feral Ashenwight
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 204*  

Feral ashenwights retain a fragment of the spark they had in life. However, they are devoid of memories or thoughts beyond a compulsive desire to destroy all living creatures they encounter.

## Ashenwights

When a Humanoid consumed by cruelty and rage dies in an area corrupted by the Far Realm, the creature sometimes rises as an ashenwight. The skin of these Undead horrors is desiccated, and their eyes often glow with otherworldly power.
