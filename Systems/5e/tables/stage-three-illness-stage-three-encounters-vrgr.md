**Stage Three Encounters**

`dice: [](stage-three-illness-stage-three-encounters-vrgr.md#^stage-three-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A dead body lies in the character's path. A character who touches the body must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 2 | A retching [commoner](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) tries to grapple the character, begging for any help. Anyone the commoner touches must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 3 | Three Casques Silencieux ([animated armor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md)) gesture for the character to get indoors immediately. They turn hostile if the character resists. |
| 4 | Several mangy [giant rats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md) attack. Anyone bitten by a giant rat must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 5 | A [swarm of rats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-rats.md) shadows the character as they travel. If confronted, the swarm attacks. Anyone bitten by the rats must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague. |
| 6 | A young, well-heeled couple cavorts openly, oblivious to the quarantine. These [wererats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/wererat.md) don't reveal their true nature unless they must, and then only to blend in with the swarms of rats. |
