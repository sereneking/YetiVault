# Mysterious Islands
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 211* 

Small islands dot most oceans, distant or unexplored locales that might host all manner of adventures. The following rules can be used to generate any islands the characters might encounter.

## Island Size

These rules are used to generate islands with areas roughly `1d6` miles long and `1d6` miles wide. Most islands aren't perfect rectangles, and most coastlines aren't perfectly straight, so feel free to make areas of the island shorter, longer, thinner, or wider as you see fit.

## Island Habitat

An island can have any habitat that seems appropriate for the clime it occupies. For example, islands of floating ice are found in arctic seas, while islands with jungle habitats are found in tropical waters. Not all islands are created by nature, though. A powerful spellcaster or divine being could conjure an island made of crystal, iron, or any material you choose.

## Island Theme

Each island encountered has a theme chosen or rolled on the Island Theme table. This theme defines the island's story in one broad stroke. Once you have a theme, consult its section after the table to determine related details and story hooks.

### Alien

Alien islands are inhabited by isolated creatures with ways of life beyond most beings' comprehensions. Everything about the culture of the island, from architecture to food, is unfamiliar and unsettling to outsiders. At your discretion the inhabitants of the island might speak, read, and write a language all their own.

### Cursed

Cursed islands are steeped in dark magic from a ritual cast by necromancers, hag covens, evil spellcasters, foul deities, or worse. The island might still hold some hint as to why it was cursed, or all trace of those who brought down the affliction might have been scoured away.

**Island Curses**

`dice: [](mysterious-islands-gos.md#^island-curses)`

| dice: d6 | Curse |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | When a creature dies on the island, its spirit rises as a [specter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) `1d4` hours after death. The specter is obsessed with killing its former friends. |
| 2 | Creatures that aren't inhabitants of the island must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour they spend on the island. If they fail, they gain one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). The DC for this check equals 10 + the number of hours spent on the island. |
| 3 | Each day at dawn, the island conjures `2d10` [magma mephits](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/magma-mephit.md), which are hostile toward creatures that aren't inhabitants of the island. |
| 4 | When a creature that isn't an inhabitant of the island completes a long rest there, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 8 hours. |
| 5 | Creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour they spend on the island. If they fail, they gain a 1-inch scar in a random place on their body. Only a [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or similar magic removes the scar. |
| 6 | When a creature that isn't an inhabitant of the island completes a long rest there, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain a random form of long-term madness (see ""Madness"" in chapter 8, ""Running the Game"," of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). |
