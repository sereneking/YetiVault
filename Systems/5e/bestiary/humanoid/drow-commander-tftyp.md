## Traits

***Special Equipment.*** The drow carries three magical bolts, as follows:

- A *bolt of holding*, which casts [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md) on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target  
- A *bolt of blinding*, which casts [blindness/deafness](/Systems/5e/spells/blindness-deafness.md) to blind on a target hit with the bolt, as well as up to two other targets within 30 feet of that target  
- A *bolt of vapors*, which casts [stinking cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/stinking-cloud.md) centered on the point it hits  

Each of these effects has a spell save DC of 15 and a duration of 1 minute.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword +2.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d6 + 6`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow +1.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
