## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Exethanter fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Rejuvenation.*** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

***Turn Resistance.*** Exethanter has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

***Spellcasting.*** Exethanter is an 18th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, `+12` to hit with spell attacks). Exethanter has the following wizard spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [prestidigitation](/Systems/5e/spells/prestidigitation.md), [ray of frost](/Systems/5e/spells/ray-of-frost.md)

## Actions

***Paralyzing Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (`3d6`) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Legendary Actions

***Cantrip.*** Exethanter casts a cantrip.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** Exethanter uses its Paralyzing Touch.

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** Exethanter fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. The [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Exethanter's gaze for the next 24 hours.

***Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of Exethanter must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
