**Cosmic Horror Settings**

`dice: [](cosmic-horror-settings-vrgr.md#^cosmic-horror-settings)`

| dice: d8 | Setting |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A wind-blasted dimension of indigo sand and eyeless statues |
| 2 | A world with slowly vanishing land masses being consumed by an obsidian sea |
| 3 | A kingdom of rusting spires ruled by oblivious academics |
| 4 | A land possessed by fear of the colossi that move only during dawn and dusk |
| 5 | A red ocean that manifested without warning |
| 6 | An ambulatory forest riddled with glowing eyes |
| 7 | A kingdom of undying monarchs who outnumber their frightened subjects |
| 8 | A dimension of featureless white, broken up only by the eyes that blink across the landscape |
