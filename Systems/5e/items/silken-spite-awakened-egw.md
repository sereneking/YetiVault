# Silken Spite (Awakened)
*Melee Weapon, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Finesse), Martial, [Vestige](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The blade of this rapier is made of spider silk. Its onyx pommel is tipped with a ruby cut in the shape of a spider, and the blade carries the blessing of Lolth.

## Sentience

Silken Spite is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Undercommon.

## Personality

A murderous [yochlol](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/yochlol.md) named Sinnafex lives within Silken Spite. The weapon speaks in whispers, pushing its wielder to trust no one and to kill those who cause the slightest personal offense.

## Dormant

The rapier grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal, Elvish, and Undercommon.  
- You have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision), being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) by 60 feet.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
- You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) while [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.  
- While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were difficult terrain.  

> [!note] Betrayer Artifact Properties
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and one [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and an additional [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [major beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.

## Awakened

The rapier grants the following benefits in its awakened state:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.  
- The saving throw DC for the weapon's poison increases to 15.  
- While holding the rapier, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 15): [cloudkill](/Systems/5e/spells/cloudkill.md), [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md), or [web](/Systems/5e/spells/web.md). Once a spell has been cast using the rapier, that spell can't be cast from the rapier again until the next dawn.
