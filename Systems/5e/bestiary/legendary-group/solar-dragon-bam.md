# Solar Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie_

A solar dragon customarily lairs in a star's radiant core or nests in a gigantic, hollowed-out rock engulfed by the star's blinding radiance. A star in which a solar dragon makes its lair has the following effects on creatures:

- **Blinding Radiance..** A creature that is within 10 miles of the star or inside it is blinded by its intense light unless the creature has protective gear to shield its eyes, such as goggles of night or a similar form of eyewear.  
- **Stellar Incineration..** Any creature that enters the star or starts its turn inside it takes 132 (`24d10`) radiant damage.
