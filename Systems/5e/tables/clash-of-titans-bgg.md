| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Frost giants besiege a fire giant settlement, disrupting travel and trade across the region. Injured frost giants shelter in nearby towns, demanding the people there serve them while they recover. |
| 2 | A dragon and a giant, in the middle of a fierce battle, suddenly fall from the sky into a town square. Neither combatant is concerned about protecting the people around them. |
| 3 | Hired to guard a caravan heading to a remote mountain town, adventurers find the pass blocked with rockslides caused by stone giants at play. |
| 4 | A group of giants (perhaps members of the Stewards of the Eternal Throne, described in "chapter 2") warns a city that the [tarrasque](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) is approaching and asks for heroes to evacuate the city while the giants hold the monster at bay. |
| 5 | A terrifying storm lashes a fishing village for days. After helping people get to safety, the adventurers investigate the storm, and they discover a storm giant locked in battle with a kraken nearby. |
| 6 | After slumbering for centuries, a [scion of Grolantor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/scion-of-grolantor-bgg.md) (described in "chapter 6)", begins to stir. The residents of the farming village built on the sleeping giant's back seek help evacuating. |
