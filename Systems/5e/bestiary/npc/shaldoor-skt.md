## Traits

***Roleplaying Information.*** A skilled rider of rocs and whales, Shaldoor believes that Annam the All-Father shattered the ordning to push giants into war against the dragons. She is thrilled to be on the front lines in this great conflict!

Ideal: "Giants are made for warâ€”storm giants most of all!"

Bond: "Ostoria is gone, yet I long for the return of a mighty giant empire."

Flaw: "I like to rain destruction down upon my enemies, and I never show them mercy."

***Amphibious.*** Shaldoor can breathe air and water.

***Spellcasting.*** Shaldoor casts one of the following spells, requiring no material spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md), [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) (cast as 1 action), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Shaldoor makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`6d6 + 9`) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`4d12 + 9`) bludgeoning damage.

***Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).*** Shaldoor hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
