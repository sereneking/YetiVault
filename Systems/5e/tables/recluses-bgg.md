| 2 | A new settlement in a remote region seeks to hire adventurers to get rid of a giant lairing nearby. The giant just wants to be left alone and is tired of having to move every few decades as other creatures crowd too close to the giant's dwelling. |
| 3 | Adventurers are hired to deal with a rampaging wild beast, but they discover the beast has a collar. The beast's owner is a giant who was forced to move recently, and the beast got lost trying to find its new home. |
| 4 | A wandering giant comes to a city looking for people who are knowledgeable about the world and might possess maps of remote regions. City authorities point the giant to the adventurers. |
| 5 | An approaching giant alarms the people of a small town, who ask the adventurers to protect them. But the peaceful giant is just searching for a new community of giants to join after fleeing a community ravaged by internal conflict. The giant agrees to leave the town in peace if the adventurers will help find a new home for the giant. |
| 6 | Adventurers stumble across the humble abode of a reclusive giant who is hungry for company and doesn't want them to leave. |
