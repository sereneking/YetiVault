# Booyahg Whip
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 42*  

Khurgorbaeyag saw fit to gift this goblin with powers that enable it to dominate others. The goblin has `1d3` other goblins that slavishly obey its orders.

## Booyahgs

Spellcasters of any sort among the goblins are rare. Goblins typically lack the intelligence and patience needed to learn and practice wizardry, and they fare poorly even when given access to the necessary training and knowledge. Sorcerers are less prevalent among them than in many other races, and Khurgorbaeyag seems to dislike sharing his divine power with his followers. And although many goblins would readily offer anything to have the abilities of a warlock, the patrons that grant such power know a goblin is unlikely to be able to uphold its end of any bargain.

Even when a goblin is born with the ability to become a spellcaster, the knowledge and talent necessary to carry on the tradition rarely persists for more than a couple of generations. Because they have so little experience with magic, goblins make no distinction between its forms. To them all magic is "booyahg," and the word is part of the name they give to any of its practitioners.

A goblin with access to booyahg becomes a member of the lashers and can often rise to the role of boss.
