# Bone Roc
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 211*  

A bone roc is a birdlike Undead that can incorporate the bones of multiple flying creatures. Despite their name, bone rocs aren't always reanimated skeletons of rocs. You may customize a bone roc by rolling on the Bone Roc Sources table to determine the type of bones used and how that affects its stat block.
