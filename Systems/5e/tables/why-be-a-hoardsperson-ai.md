**Why Be a Hoardsperson?**

`dice: [](why-be-a-hoardsperson-ai.md#^why-be-a-hoardsperson)`

| dice: d8 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You once tried to dive into a huge pool of gold coins. It hurt. |
| 2 | You've been betrayed by your adventuring party before, and there's no way now that you'll trust anyone else to hold on to the loot |
| 3 | Once, through a series of increasingly complex negotiations, you traded a paper clip for temporary control of a minor fiefdom. |
| 4 | Material possessions don't mean that much to you. Or at least that's the story you're going with. |
| 5 | You've never had a problem spending other people's money. Surely keeping other people's money can't be that hard. |
| 6 | You believe there's no such thing as worthless goods. Only unmotivated buyers. |
| 7 | You're not a hoarder. More of a passionate collector. You can stop anytime you want. Really. |
| 8 | Given the personalities of the other party members, it was mutually agreed that you were the only one who could be trusted |
