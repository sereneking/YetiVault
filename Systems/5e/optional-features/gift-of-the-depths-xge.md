*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 57*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level

You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

You can also cast [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md) once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
