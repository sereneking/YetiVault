# Queen of Witches

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Queen of Witches takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Conjure Crystal Wall.** A wall of softly glowing crystal springs up from a solid surface the Queen can see within 120 feet of her. The wall is 60 feet long, 10 feet high, 5 feet thick, blocks line of sight, and sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. When the wall appears, each creature within its area is pushed out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants, and must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) radiant damage. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 15, 10 hp, vulnerability to thunder damage, resistance to fire, slashing, and piercing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The wall remains until the Queen uses this lair action again, until she dismisses it as a bonus action, or until she dies.  
- **Disrupt Spellcasting.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, each creature, other than fey, that casts a spell while within 60 feet of the Queen must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails, expending the spell slot.  
- **Moonlight Blast.** A searing flare of moonlight bursts from a point the Queen can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (`3d8`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature not in its true form has disadvantage on the saving throw, and if it fails, it reverts to its true form.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the Queen of Witches's lair is warped by the queen's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Lunar Constancy.** Despite the weather, the moon is always visible for most of the night within 10 miles of the lair. Cloud cover has many breaks, or the moon's light sharply penetrates the clouds.  
- **Moonlit Audience.** Calling the Queen of Witches's name under the light of the moon within 3 miles of her lair draws her attention. She can choose to teleport to the supplicant and hear their request. For 24 hours after the invocation, even if the Queen never teleported to the supplicant, she has a connection to the area where the supplicant called for her and can teleport to an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it or back to her lair as an action.  
- **Susurrating Fog.** Silvery fog is common within 10 miles of the lair, and strange whispers are heard within the mist.  

If the Queen of Witches dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
