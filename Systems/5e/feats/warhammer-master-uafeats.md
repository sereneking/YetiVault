# Warhammer Master
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats p. 2*  

> [!note]
> This feat is presented as an illustrative example of a poorly-designed feat, and is not intended to be used in play. The [Fell Handed](/Systems/5e/feats/fell-handed-uafeats.md) feat is presented as a well-designed implementation of the same ideas, and should be used instead.

When you hit a creature with a [warhammer](/Systems/5e/items/warhammer.md), the  creature must succeed on a Strength saving  throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your  Strength modifier) or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

In addition, you can use your warhammer to  knock away a foe's shield. If you hit a creature  that's using a shield, you can have the attack deal  no damage and force the creature to drop its  shield.
