## Class Features

### Sidekick Class (Level 1)

To gain the expert class, a creature must have at least one language in its stat block that it can speak.

> [!note]
> this class is intended for NPC [sidekicks](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/sidekicks-uasidekicks.md).

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

At 1st level, the sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Dexterity, Intelligence, or Constitution.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in five skills of your choice. If the sidekick is a humanoid, it also gains proficiency with light armor, simple weapons, and two tools of your choice.

At 13th level, the sidekick gains proficiency in one skill of your choice. If the sidekick is a humanoid, it also gains proficiency with one tool of your choice.

### Expertise (Level 1)

At 1st level, choose two of the sidekick's skill proficiencies. The sidekick's proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check it makes that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.

At 6th level and again at 17th level, choose two more of the sidekick's skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.

### Helpful (Level 1)

The sidekick is adept at giving well-timed assistance; the sidekick can take the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action as a bonus action.

### Cunning Action (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, the sidekick's agility or quick thinking allows it to act speedily. On its turn in combat, it can take the [Dash](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Disengage), or [Hide](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action.

### Jack of Many Trades (Level 3)

Beginning at 3rd level, the sidekick can add half its proficiency bonus to any ability check it makes that uses a skill but doesn't already include its proficiency bonus.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Proficiency Versatility (Level 4)
_Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 1_

*4th-level feature (enhances Ability Score Improvement)*

When you gain the Ability Score Improvement feature from your class, you can also replace one of your skill proficiencies with a skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level (the proficiency you replace needn't be from the class).

This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.

### Extra Attack (Level 5)

Starting at 5th level, the sidekick can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on its turn.

### Expertise (Level 6)

At 6th level, you gain another Expertise.

### Evasion (Level 7)

Beginning at 7th level, because of extraordinary good luck, the sidekick is skilled at avoiding certain dangers. When the sidekick is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it failed. The sidekick doesn't benefit from this feature while [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain another Ability Score Improvement.

### Proficiency Versatility (Level 8)

### Inspiring Help (1d6) (Level 9)

Starting at 9th level, the sidekick's assistance becomes especially inspiring. When the sidekick uses its Helpful bonus action, the creature who receives the help also gains a `1d6` bonus to the `d20` roll. If that roll is an attack roll, the creature can forgo adding the bonus to it, and then if the attack hits, the creature can add the bonus to the attack's damage roll against one target.

At 18th level, the bonus increases to `2d6`.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 10)

At 10th level, you gain another Ability Score Improvement.

### Reliable Talent (Level 11)

By 11th level, the sidekick has refined its skills to an exceptional degree. Whenever the sidekick makes an ability check that includes its whole proficiency bonus, it can treat a `d20` roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.

### Stroke of Luck (Level 20)

At 20th level, the sidekick has an uncanny knack for turning failure into success. If the sidekick's attack misses a target within range, it can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if it fails an ability check, it can treat the `d20` roll as a 20.

Once it uses this feature, the sidekick can't use it again until it finishes a short or long rest.
