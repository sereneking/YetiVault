**Shadow Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-shadow-dragon-shadow-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^shadow-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Merciless. Life doesn't offer second chances, and neither do I. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Hedonism. The multiverse is painful enough. Seek pleasure wherever you can find it. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Cruelty. The only release for my pain is to visit it upon others. (Evil) |
| 4 | Aspiration. I will one day find an escape from this condemnation. (Any) |
| 5 | Self-Serving. The petty concerns of other creatures are of no concern to me. I have enough to occupy my attention. (Neutral) |
| 6 | Compassion. My existence is misery, and no one else should have to suffer such torment. (Good) |
