# Birdfolk Sailor
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 191*  

For birdfolk who take up the seafaring trade, their home is as much on the ocean as it is at port. They relish the salt spray and stiff winds, finding the closed spaces of forest life to be stifling compared to the wide-open expanse of the sea.

> [!note] Peculiar Design
> 
> Birdfolk ship design often causes confusion among other seafaring races due to the relative absence of rigging. While cordage is needed to keep sails in place and cargo stored, nets and climbing ropes prove less necessary when the crew is capable of limited flight. A birdfolk sailor can simply lash a rope to their leg, open their wings, and let the ocean breeze carry them up to the sails or to a lookout post on the main mast.
