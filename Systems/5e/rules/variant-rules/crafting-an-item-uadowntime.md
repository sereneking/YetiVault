# Crafting an Item
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 7* 

If you can't buy or find the item you need, you can attempt to craft it.

## Resources

A character needs the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, and raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if their combined cost is 50 gp or less.

For items that cost more than 50 gp, a character can complete them over long periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. As DM, use your judgement when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. As DM, you need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency | Items |
|-------------|-------|
| [Herbalism kit](/Systems/5e/items/herbalism-kit.md) | Antitoxin, [potion of healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing.md) |
| Leatherworker's tools | Leather armor, boots |
| Smith's tools | Armor, weapons |
| Weaver's tools | Cloaks, robes |

Assume that a character can sell items crafted in this way at their listed price.

## Crafting Magic Items

Magic items require more than just time, effort, and materials to create. Creating a magic item is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

Potions of healing and spell scrolls are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing Potions of Healing" in this section on crafting and "Scribing a [Spell Scroll](/Systems/5e/items/spell-scroll.md)" on page 12.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool in the Elemental Plane of Water.

Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. The creature might guard a place or resource that the characters need.

**Magic Item Ingredients**

| Item Rarity | CR Range |
|-------------|----------|
| Common | 1–3 |
| Uncommon | 4–8 |
| Rare | 9–12 |
| Very rare | 13–18 |
| Legendary | 19+ |
^magic-item-ingredients

Pick a monster or location that is a thematic fit for the item. Ideally, the two should share a similar element or nature. For example, mariner's armor might require the essence of a water weird. A [staff of charming](/Systems/5e/items/staff-of-charming.md) might need the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Creating a [staff of power](/Systems/5e/items/staff-of-power.md) might rely on finding a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic—a stone guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost needed for other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

**Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost**

| Item Rarity | Cost | Workweeks |
|-------------|------|-----------|
| Common | 50 gp | 1 |
| Uncommon | 200 gp | 5 |
| Rare | 2,000 gp | 50 |
| Very rare | 20,000 gp | 100 |
| Legendary | 100,000 gp | 500 |

To make a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as is normal for crafting any object, or the character needs proficiency in the [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill.

## Complications

Most of the complications involved in creating an item, especially a magic one, are linked to the difficulty in finding rare items needed to complete the work. The complications a character might face as byproducts of the process of creation are most interesting when the characters are working on a magic item. It's unlikely that a suit of armor or a pair of boots can cause serious complications for a character's life.

## Brewing Potions of Healing

Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character proficient with the [herbalism kit](/Systems/5e/items/herbalism-kit.md) can create them. The time and money needed to create such a potion is summarized on the [Potion of Healing](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-healing.md) Creation table.

**Potion of Healing Creation**

| Type | Time | Cost |
|------|------|------|
| Healing | 1 day | 25 gp |
| Greater healing | 1 workweek | 100 gp |
| Superior healing | 3 workweeks | 1,000 gp |
| Supreme healing | 4 workweeks | 10,000 gp |
