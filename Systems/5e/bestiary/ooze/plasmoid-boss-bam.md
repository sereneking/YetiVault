# Plasmoid Boss
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 42*  

On occasion, due to some biological anomaly, a plasmoid balloons in size upon reaching adulthood (around the age of twenty years). Plasmoids who use their increased size and strength to boss around smaller, weaker creatures can easily end up in positions of power, surrounded by loyal underlings, sycophants, and would-be usurpers. A plasmoid boss might be the master of a guild, the leader of a criminal enterprise, the lord of a plasmoid community, or the captain of a spelljamming ship. Regardless of the roles they secure for themselves, plasmoid bosses need no small amount of charm and wit, in addition to their strength and size, to stay in power for long.
