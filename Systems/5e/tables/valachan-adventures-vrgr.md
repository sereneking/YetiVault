`dice: [](valachan-adventures-vrgr.md#^valachan-adventures)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The Oselo joyously adopt a new member into their community, but the ceremony erupts in strife when Chakuna appears and demands that all newcomers participate in the Trial of Hearts. |
| 2 | Shuaran warriors seek help in slaying a massive [saber-toothed tiger](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/saber-toothed-tiger.md) killing their people. They don't mention that they recently lost the Cat of Felkovic, a sentient magic item similar to a [figurine of wondrous power](/Systems/5e/items/figurine-of-wondrous-power.md) that conjures a feline killer. |
| 3 | A sapient [giant spider](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) emerges from the caverns known as the Council of the Whip Spider. It demands that the Oselo provide it a sacrifice, or every arachnid in Valachan will attack the village. |
| 4 | The [tyrannosaurus rex](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/tyrannosaurus-rex.md) called Mother Heartless rampages from the Forest of Fossils, incensed by something amiss in her hunting grounds. |
| 5 | The [lizardfolk](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/lizardfolk.md) of the lakes surrounding the Anquara Plateau discover a submerged ruin and unleash an [aboleth](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/aboleth.md) that now holds them in thrall. |
| 6 | Beast-shaped [treants](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/treant.md) animate and lay siege to Pantara Lodge, obeying Urik von Kharkov's will. |
| 7 | The merchant ship Zodiac runs aground on Kiru Island. The sailors seek help salvaging other shipwrecks and escaping back to seaâ€”preferably before Chakuna notices them. |
| 8 | A pack of [displacer beasts](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast.md) washes up dead in Sangui Cove. An enraged Chakuna prowls the jungle, slaying anyone she suspects of being involved. |
