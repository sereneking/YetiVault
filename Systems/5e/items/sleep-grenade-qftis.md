# Sleep Grenade
*Explosive*  


This grenade releases a cloud of soporific mist that fills a 20-foot-radius sphere, then dissipates. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) condition for 1 hour. The condition ends on a creature early if the creature takes damage or if another creature uses an action to shake it awake.
