## Traits

***Reduced Threat.*** A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies), saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and saving throw DCs (included in the stat block).

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the remorhaz or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (`3d6`) fire damage.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 40 (`6d10 + 7`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the remorhaz can't bite another target.

***Swallow.*** The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.

If the remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
