# Brown Scavver
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 49, Light of Xaryxis*  

Brown scavvers are 10 feet long and range in color from sun-dappled brownish gold to dark umber. It takes them days to digest a meal, during which time they attack only in self-defense.

A brown scavver likes to swallow its prey whole. The creature's stomach is filled with poisonous gas, which kills off anything that survives being swallowed.

## Traits

***Unusual Nature.*** The scavver doesn't require air.

## Actions

***Swallowing Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the scavver. The scavver can have one creature swallowed at a time.

A swallowed creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the scavver, and takes 13 (`3d8`) poison damage at the start of each of the scavver's turns from the poisonous gas in the scavver's gullet.

If the scavver takes 15 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the scavver must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the scavver. If the scavver dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
