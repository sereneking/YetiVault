# Gigant
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 154*  

A gigant is a towering insectile creature variously regarded as a harbinger of doom, a defender of nature, and a divine messenger of mysterious purpose. Giants regard them as a plague, since gigants prefer giants over other food. Some giants claim gigants are created by the weird magical aura that surrounds a gargantua.

A gigant resembles an enormous beetle with legs ending in sharp talons. It uses its talons to bring creatures to its enormous mandibles, which are strong enough to carry a giant to the gigant's nest to be devoured.

A gigant's wings are usually folded under its carapace, but the speedy flier can also beat its wings to create a horrible sound or to spread a toxic dust.

## Traits

***Spell-Resistant Carapace.*** The gigant has advantage on saving throws against spells, and any creature that makes a spell attack against the gigant has disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gigant makes one Mandibles attack and two Talons attacks.

***Mandibles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 21 (`4d6 + 7`) slashing damage, and the target has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target takes 21 (`4d6 + 7`) slashing damage at the start of each of the gigant's turns. While the gigant is grappling a target, it can't use Mandibles against other targets.

***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`3d6 + 7`) slashing damage, and the target is pulled 10 feet straight toward the gigant.

***Scale Dust (Recharge 5-6).*** The gigant releases magical dust from its wings in a 30-foot cube. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (`10d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a success or failure, the creature has the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition for 1 hour. While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) this way, the creature can't regain hit points.

## Bonus Actions

***Drone.*** The gigant produces a horrid droning sound by rapidly beating its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the gigant must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) thunder damage and have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn. The gigant can then fly up to half its flying speed.
