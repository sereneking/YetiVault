# Crime
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 8* 

Sometimes it pays to be bad. This activity gives a character the chance to make some extra cash, at the risk of arrest.

## Resources

A crime spree requires a character to spend one week and at least 25 gp gathering information on potential targets, and then committing the crime.

## Resolution

The character must make a series of checks, with one DC for all the checks determined by the profit sought from the crime.

The chosen DC can be 10, 15, 20, or 25. Successful completion of the crime yields a number of gold pieces based on the chosen DC, as shown on the Loot Value table.

To attempt the crime, the character makes three checks: Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)), Dexterity with thieves' tools, and the player's choice of Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)), Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)), or Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)).

If none of the checks succeed, the character is caught and jailed. The character must pay a fine equal to the potential payout and must spend one week in jail per 25 gp value.

If one check succeeds, the heist fails but the character escapes.

If two checks succeed, the heist is a partial success, netting the character half the payout. If all three succeed, the character earns the full payout.

**Loot Value**

| DC | Value |
|----|-------|
| 10 | 50 gp, robbery of a struggling merchant |
| 15 | 100 gp, robbery of a prosperous merchant |
| 20 | 200 gp, robbery of a noble |
| 25 | 1,000 gp, robbery of one of the richest figures in town |

## Complications

A life of crime is filled with complications. Roll on the Crime Complications table (or create a complication of your own) if the character succeeds at only one check. If the character's foil is involved in crime or law enforcement, roll if the character succeeds on only two checks.
