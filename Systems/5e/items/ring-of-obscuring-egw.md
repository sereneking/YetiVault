# Ring of Obscuring
*Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This band of iron resembles a skull and is cold to the touch. It has 3 charges and regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. As an action while wearing the ring, you can expend 1 of its charges to cast the [fog cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md) spell from it, with the following changes: the cloud is centered on you when it first appears, and the spell lasts for 1 minute (no [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) required).
