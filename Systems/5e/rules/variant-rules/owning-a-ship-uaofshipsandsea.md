# Owning a Ship
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 9* 

If you purchase a ship, you have unlocked an exciting new venue for adventure and signed up for a mountain of logistical challenges. Keeping a ship functioning requires a tremendous amount of work.

The rules use a downtime activity—managing a ship—to abstractly represent the effort needed to keep a ship functioning, its supplies stocked, and its crew paid.

See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" and "Xanathar's Guide to Everything" for more information on downtime activities.

## Downtime: Managing a Ship

By hiring a competent captain and crew and putting them to work hauling cargo or otherwise offering their services, you can make it possible for a ship to remain in good repair and even generate a profit for you between adventures.

Managing a ship is a downtime activity that requires time and effort to recruit an officer and crew. The ship is available for use when needed. Otherwise, the ship hauls passengers and cargo to cover the costs of maintaining the ship and paying the crew.

### Resources

It takes one week to recruit a crew and `100 + 4d6` gp to cover the costs of recruitment and supplies. Once you have paid these costs, you have a captain and a crew to maintain the ship.

### Resolution

Once you have a working ship, it turns a small profit each month. At the end of every four weeks, you earn `5d20` gp.

### Complications

A ship owner runs the risk of foul weather, a bad trade deal, or a mutiny. When rolling to determine your profit, if any of the `d20` rolls are a 1, roll on the Ship Ownership Complications table (or the DM may create a suitable complication).
