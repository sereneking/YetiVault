# Survivalist
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 4*  

You master wilderness lore, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You learn the [alarm](/Systems/5e/spells/alarm.md) spell. You can cast it once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
