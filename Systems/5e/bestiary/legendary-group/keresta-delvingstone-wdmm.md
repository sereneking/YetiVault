# Keresta Delvingstone

## Regional effects
_Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage_

Vanrakdoom is Keresta's lair, and the following regional effects are noticeable throughout it:

- Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas.  
- Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.  

If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.
