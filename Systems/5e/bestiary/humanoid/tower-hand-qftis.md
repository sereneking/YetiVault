# Tower Hand
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 217*  

Tower hands belong to the Order of the Night Sky, an ancient society of martial artists who protect the sages of the Tower of the Heavens. They rarely speak and carry few worldly possessions.

## Tower Stewards

For centuries, the Tower of the Heavens has been stewarded by dutiful folk who practice two distinct traditions.
