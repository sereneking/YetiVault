# Aqua Delerium
*Potion, rare*  


This purple potion glows dimly with octarine light. It swirls and sparkles in its small stoppered bottle.

When you drink this potion, you regain expended spell slots. Roll `1d6` - you choose spell slots to regain that have a combined level that is equal to or less than the result. None of the slots can be higher than 5th level.

For one hour after drinking aqua delerium, roll `1d20` each time you cast a spell of 1st level or higher. On a 1, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

If you consume more than one dose of aqua delerium before finishing your next long rest, you take (`1d12`) necrotic damage for each spell level regained, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken until you finish a long rest. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

When a creature who cannot cast spells using spell slots drinks aqua delerium, it takes 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and gains one level of contamination.
