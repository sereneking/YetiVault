| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Curiosity. The best way to show you value others is to learn as much as you can about them. (Good) |
| 2 | Perspective. Everyone sees things differently, so if you want to know about the world, gather as many different points of view as you can. (Any) |
| 3 | Knowledge. What's the point of living for centuries if you don't learn all there is to know? (Any) |
| 4 | Self-Determination. All creatures have the right to make their own decisions about their lives and ultimate destinies. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | Compassion. Sharing each other's pain and loss brings us all closer to peace and unity. (Good) |
| 6 | Cruelty. The most hilarious thing about lesser creatures who think they're important is how outraged they get when I hurt them. (Evil) |
