# Initiate (Dissenter)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 11*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set, vehicles (land)  
- **Equipment.** A simple puzzle box, a scroll containing the basic teachings of the five gods, a gaming set, a set of [common clothes](/Systems/5e/items/common-clothes.md), and a belt [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 15 gp. If you have completed any trials before the start of the campaign, you also have any cartouches you have earned  

Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife.

Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.

A character who is identified as a dissenter loses the benefit of the initiate's or vizier's background feature. In its place, the character gains the Shelter of Dissenters feature.

You are an initiate, on the path to completing the trials of the five gods in the hope of earning a glorified death in the final Trial of Zeal. Some combination of your natural aptitude, your crop's needs, and your teachers' assessment while you were an acolyte led you to focus your training in one particular area of specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or spellcasting. But only a well-rounded initiate can be called truly worthy of the afterlife.

If you are a hand-to-hand specialist, consider the [barbarian](/Systems/5e/classes/barbarian.md), [fighter](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter.md), [monk](/Systems/5e/classes/monk.md), [paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md), or [rogue](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue.md) classes. As a long-range combat specialist, you might be a [fighter](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter.md), a [ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md), or a [rogue](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue.md). If you are a spellcasting specialist, you might be a [bard](/Systems/5e/classes/bard.md), [sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), or [wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md). And beyond this initial choice, you might consider multiclassing or using feats to round out your skills in all three areas.

## Feature: Shelter of Dissenters

If they wish to have any hope of survival, whether hiding within the city or cast out into the desert, dissenters must help each other. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other dissenters. They will help shield you from those who hunt you, possibly even risking their lives for you.

## Suggested Characteristics

An initiate's life is focused on the trials, but it doesn't need to be all about the trials. Though some initiates are highly focused on their training, most undergo that training while also experiencing joy, sorrow, love, loss, anger, jealousy, hope, faith, delight—the whole range of mortal emotions and experience. The afterlife might be a constant presence in every initiate's mind, but it is the culmination of a life well-lived—not a replacement for it.
