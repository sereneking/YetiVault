# Crown of the Forest
*Wondrous Item, uncommon*  


While wearing this crown, a character automatically fails any Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check made to see through an illusion. An illusion that is touched still has its true nature revealed. However, a character wearing a crown has such a strong sense that the illusion is real that they might not know which of their senses to believe.

If this crown is closely examined by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) or Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check, or with a [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) spell cast using a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, the nature of its magic is discovered.
