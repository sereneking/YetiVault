# Neogi Void Hunter
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 41*  

A neogi void hunter is bigger than a typical adult neogi and often fills the role of captain aboard a nightspider (see the *Astral Adventurer's Guide*). The void hunter pledges fealty to one or more stellar entities in exchange for a taste of their immense power. These entities—known by such names as Acamar, Caiphon, Gibbeth, and Hadar—resemble stars and embody the essence of evil.

## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the neogi's darkvision.

***Mental Fortitude.*** The neogi has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and magic can't put the neogi to sleep.

***Spider Climb.*** The neogi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Spellcasting.*** The neogi casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability:

**1/day each**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The neogi makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks, or it makes two Eldritch Bolt attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Eldritch Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (`3d10 + 4`) force damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Enslave (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The neogi targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the neogi for 1 day, or until the neogi dies or is more than 1 mile from the target. The [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target obeys the neogi's commands and can't take reactions, and the neogi and the target can communicate telepathically with each other at a distance of up to 1 mile. Whenever the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
