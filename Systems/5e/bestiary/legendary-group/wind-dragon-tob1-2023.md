# Wind Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Air Blast.** A torrent of wind blasts outward in a 60-footâ€‘radius sphere centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the end of its next turn. Flying creatures, other than wind dragons, have disadvantage on the saving throw.  
- **Blinding Wind.** Sand and dust swirls up from the ground in a cylinder that is 30 feet tall with a 20-foot radius, centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The area within the cylinder is difficult terrain. A creature that enters the cylinder for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. The cylinder of sand and dust lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  
- **Gale Force Smash.** A blast of wind slams into a surface of the lair and sends fragments of ice and stone flying out from a point on the ground, wall, or ceiling the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
