| dice: d8 | Learning Experience |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | You traveled with a charlatan alchemist for years, until they were arrested for selling fake healing potions. You still remember how to get the taste just right. |
| 2 | You were once the head dishwasher in a famous wizard's college. |
| 3 | One of your parents was a healer in a small outpost, and they taught you that even the most mundane flora and natural materials can be used to wondrous effect. |
| 4 | While lost in the Underdark, you were forced to consume mold, fungus, and insect parts to survive. You developed a taste for that sort of thing. |
| 5 | You think you might be addicted to holy water. You just can't stop drinking it long enough to find out for sure. |
| 6 | You were once the personnel manager of a struggling business and needed to come up with a herbal cure-all that would keep employees awake for eighteen-hour shifts. No one died. Mostly. |
| 7 | As the child of a wealthy and despotic noble, you learned to smell [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) pastries a mile off. A shame that your siblings weren't so talented. |
| 8 | As a server in a tavern, you refined the perfect hangover cure but never wrote the recipe down. Now you're desperate to recreate it. |
