# Beguiling Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter p. 1*  

Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits the target, the target can't attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the end of your next turn. The target ignores this effect if it is immune to the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition. This effect also ends if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.
