**Why Be a Cartographer?**

`dice: [](why-be-a-cartographer-ai.md#^why-be-a-cartographer)`

| dice: d8 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | A paranoid person by nature, you like seeing what's ahead of you at all times. |
| 2 | Your parent was a cartographer, their parent was a cartographer, and by the gods, you're going to be one too. |
| 3 | You're fairly certain no one else in your party even knows how to hold a map, let alone read one. |
| 4 | You like spyglasses. A lot. |
| 5 | Your nickname as a child was "the cartography kid." |
| 6 | Contrary to popular opinion, the destination is much, much more important than the journey. |
| 7 | A good map is like an adventure without the bugs. And the mud. And the wolves. |
| 8 | You suffer from the nagging feeling of never knowing why you've come into a room, and you need the professional flourish that lets you cover for that. |
