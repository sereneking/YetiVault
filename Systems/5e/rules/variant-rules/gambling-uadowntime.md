# Gambling
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 9* 

Games of chance are a way to make a fortune, but perhaps a better way to lose one.

## Resources

This activity requires one workweek of effort from a character, plus the character must risk at least 100 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp, unless you decide that gambling is a big enough business to support larger wagers.

## Resolution

The player must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that you never know who might end up sitting across the table from you.

The character makes three checks: Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)), Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)), and Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)). The DC is 5` + 2d10`, generating a separate DC for each check. Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character does.

**Gambling Results**

| Result | Value |
|--------|-------|
| 0 successes | Lose all the money you bet, plus accrue a debt equal to that amount. |
| 1 success | Lose half the money you bet. |
| 2 successes | Gain one-and-a-half times the amount you bet. |
| 3 successes | Gain double the amount you bet. |

## Complications

Gambling tends to draw a variety of unsavory characters. The potential complications involved in it come from run-ins with the law and various criminals tied to it.
