# Protean Abomination
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 201*  

Occasionally, a creature's rapid mutations become too much for its body to withstand. In a horrific shower of gore, such wretches explode into a quivering mass of cancerous tumors, babbling mouths, shifting eyes, and grasping limbs that twist, expand, and retract in grotesque and bizarre ways.

## Traits

***Absorption.*** When the protean abomination kills a creature that is neither a construct nor undead, it absorbs the corpse into its body and regains 20 hit points.

***Amorphous.*** The protean abomination can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Spider Climb.*** The protean abomination can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The protean abomination makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Large or smaller target, the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15), and the protean abomination uses Engulf on it.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Engulf.*** The protean abomination engulfs a Large or smaller creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it. Until the grapple ends the target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and unable to breathe, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the abomination's turns or take 19 (`3d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage. If the abomination moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The abomination can have only one creature engulfed at a time.
