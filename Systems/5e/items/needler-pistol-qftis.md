# Needler Pistol
*Adventuring Gear*  


This strange pistol resembles a flask with a honeycomb of tubes sticking out its front. The weapon is powered by an [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) stored at the base of the flask. Placing a full [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) in the pistol gives the pistol 10 charges.

As an action while holding this pistol, you can expend 1 of its charges to fire a burst of glowing, needlelike darts from the pistol in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `8d4` piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Replacing the Energy Cell

While the pistol has charges remaining, its [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) can't be removed. Once the pistol has 0 charges, you can replace the [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
