# Caiphon's Beacon
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Great Old One" Patron

The purple star Caiphon is the doom of inexperienced mariners. Those who use its deceptive light to guide their travels invariably come to ruin. You gain proficiency in the [Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception) and [Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth) skills, and you have advantage on attack rolls against [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creatures.
