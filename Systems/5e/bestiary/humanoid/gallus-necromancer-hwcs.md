# Gallus Necromancer
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Gallus aren't typically drawn down the path of necromancy, but a few mavericks with arcane talent and the inclination to study the darker side of magic have found success in The Avium. More commonly, such necromancers study the art theoretically, learning how it disrupts the balance of life and death so that their students can be taught how to effectively counter such vile spells.

## Traits

***Glide.*** When falling at least 10 feet, the necromancer can spend a reaction to fly up to their speed in one direction as they descend. The necromancer lands in an unoccupied space at the end of their movement, and takes no falling damage. The necromancer cannot glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though they can drop any held items as part of their reaction).

***Wing Flap.*** As a bonus action, the necromancer can use their powerful feathered arms to propel themselves upward up to half their movement speed. The necromancer can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding.
