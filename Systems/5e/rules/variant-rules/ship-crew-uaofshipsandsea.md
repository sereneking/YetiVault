# Ship Crew
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 6* 

A ship requires a number of able-bodied sailors to crew it, as specified in its stat block. A crew's skill, experience, morale, and health are defined by its quality score. A crew starts with a quality score of +4, and that score varies over time, going as low as -10 and as high as +10. It decreases as a crew takes casualties, suffers hardship, or endures poor health. It increases if the crew enjoys high morale, has good health care, and receives clear, fair leadership.

A typical crew member uses the commoner stat block in the Monster Manual.

> [!note] Loyalty and Quality
> 
> When dealing with an individual member of the crew, you might find it useful to use the optional loyalty rule from chapter 4 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. To convert a quality score to an individual's loyalty score, add 10 to the crew's quality score.

## Mutiny

A poorly led or mistreated crew might turn against its officers. Once per day, if a crew's quality score is lower than 0, the captain must make a Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check modified by the crew's quality score. If the check total is between 1 and 9, the crew's quality score decreases by 1.

If the check total is 0 or lower, the crew mutinies. They become hostile to the officers and might attempt to kill them, imprison them, or throw them overboard. The crew can be cowed into obedience through violence, combat, or offers of treasure and other rewards. When the DM ends the mutiny, the crew's quality score increases by `1d4`.

## Shore Leave

Life aboard a ship is a constant wear on the crew. Spending time in port allows the crew to relax and regain its composure.

If a crew's quality score is 3 or lower, the score increases by 1 for each day the crew spends in port or ashore.
