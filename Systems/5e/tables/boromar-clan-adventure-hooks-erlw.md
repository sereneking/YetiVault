| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Daask forces capture Boromar family members who are visiting Sharn from the Talenta Plains. The Boromars offer a reward for the safe return of their family and a larger reward for the kidnappers' heads, leading to gang violence in the streets. |
| 2 | A beloved Sharn Watch captain who openly spoke out against the Boromar Clan disappears. The Boromars claim they had nothing to do with it, but some Sharn Watch members use the incident as an excuse to go after the organization. |
| 3 | A changeling stole a smuggled artifact of great value from the Boromar Clan. Boromar enforcers shake down people all over Sharn to find it, and clan leaders consider going to war with the Tyrants. |
| 4 | The Boromars stage a festival in Callestan for Saidan's birthday. All of the family's allies will be there, creating opportunities for espionage and assassination. |
