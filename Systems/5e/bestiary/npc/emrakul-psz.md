## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Emrakul fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** Emrakul has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Reflective Carapace.*** Any time Emrakul is targeted by a [magic missile](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-missile.md) spell, a line spell, or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a `d6`. On a 1 to 5, Emrakul is unaffected. On a 6, Emrakul is unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as though it originated from Emrakul, turning the caster into the target.

***Siege Monster.*** Emrakul deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Emrakul can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes five attacks: one with its bite, two with its claws, one with its horns, and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+19` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 36 (`4d12 + 10`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and Emrakul can't bite another target.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+19` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`4d8 + 10`) slashing damage.

***Horns.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+19` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (`4d10 + 10`) piercing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+19` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`4d6 + 10`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Emrakul's choice within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if Emrakul is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Emrakul's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Swallow.*** Emrakul makes one bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside Emrakul, and it takes 56 (`16d6`) acid damage at the start of each of Emrakul's turns.

If Emrakul takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, Emrakul must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of Emrakul. If Emrakul dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Emrakul makes one claw attack or tail attack.

***Move.*** Emrakul moves up to half its speed.

***Chomp (Costs 2 Actions).*** Emrakul makes one bite attack or uses its Swallow.
