**Zodiac Phenomena**

`dice: [](zodiac-phenomena-bmt.md#^zodiac-phenomena)`

| dice: d12 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Skull. The unliving surge with renewed zeal. Undead in the region gain 13 (`3d8`) "temporary hit points" daily at dusk. |
| 2 | Balance. Each creature in the region intuitively knows the immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities of any creature it sees in the region. |
| 3 | Sage. Emotions are muted in the region, but minds open to new ideas. Creatures in the region have advantage on Charisma checks made to improve the attitude of other creatures in the region. |
| 4 | Throne. The resolve of the law-abiding is bolstered, while rebels are emboldened to passionately pursue their causes. Creatures in the region are immune to the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition. |
| 5 | Key. A creature can unlock an object in this region simply by touching it, even if the lock is magical. |
| 6 | Flames. Emotions in the region become more intense. Whenever a creature in the region tries to alter the attitude of another, a failed Charisma check always results in the latter creature turning hostile if it wasn't hostile already. |
| 7 | Knight. Spectral knights routinely fly across the sky. Whenever the characters are outdoors and become embroiled in combat in the region, one or more knights descend from the sky to help them, provided none of the characters is evil. Each round on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the knights deal 9 (`2d8`) force damage to each of the characters' enemies. After the battle, the knights bow, then disappear. |
| 8 | Euryale. Natural vegetation in the region grows poisonous thorns. A creature that enters or ends its turn in "difficult terrain" caused by this vegetation must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) poison damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature instead has 1 hit point and has the [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) condition until that condition is removed by the [Greater Restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell or similar magic. |
| 9 | Rogue. Sneaks find their efforts easier in the region. Creatures in the region make Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks with advantage. |
| 10 | Gem. At midnight on a clear night, the stars appear to multiply tenfold, then rain down to the ground as minuscule silver meteorites. In all, 100 gp worth of silver falls harmlessly from the sky, scattered throughout the region. |
| 11 | Talons. Some magic is suppressed in the region. Common magic items, cantrips, and 1st-level spells don't function within this area. |
| 12 | Jester. Misfortune besets people in the region. Whenever a Humanoid in the region makes an ability check or an attack roll and rolls a 1 on the `d20`, it has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition until the end of its next turn, as it is magically overcome with laughter. |
