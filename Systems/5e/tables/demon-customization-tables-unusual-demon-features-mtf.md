| 3 | Ever-Open Extra Eye. The demon gains advantage on Perception checks related to sight. |
| 4 | Bleeds Wasps. The first time in each combat the demon is reduced to half its hit points or less, a [swarm of insects (wasps)](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-wasps.md) forms around it. The swarm considers creatures other than the demon to be enemies. |
| 5 | Extra Arm. The demon gains advantage on Sleight of Hand checks. |
| 6 | Enormous Ears. The demon gains advantage on Perception checks to hear sounds. |
| 7 | Silver Bones. The demon's natural weapons are considered silvered. |
| 8 | Snake Hair. Creatures that grapple the demon or are grappled by it are poisoned until the grapple ends. |
| 9 | Endlessly Mumbling Second Mouth. The demon suffers disadvantage on Stealth checks against creatures that can hear. |
| 10 | Huge Feet. The demon suffers disadvantage on Stealth, Athletics, and Acrobatics checks when they involve moving its feet. |
| 11 | Translucent Skin. The demon's skin is slimy and translucent. It has advantage on attempts to escape a grapple. |

| 14 | Worm Tongue. The demon can't speak any language. |
