# Lorehold Primer
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


The Lorehold Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Lorehold College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)) or Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself `1d4` bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the `d20`.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the cleric or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
