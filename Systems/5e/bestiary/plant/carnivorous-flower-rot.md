## Traits

***Limited Telepathy.*** The plant can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The plant makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (`1d10`) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`1d8`) piercing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 13) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until the grapple ends. The plant has two tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Tentacle Slam.*** The plant slams creatures [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`2d6 + 3`) bludgeoning damage and be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the plant's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning damage and isn't [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned).
