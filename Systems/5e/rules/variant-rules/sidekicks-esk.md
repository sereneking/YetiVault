# Sidekicks
*Source: Essentials Kit p. 63* 

On your adventures, the DM might reveal that you've befriended a special character called a sidekick, who joins your party. This appendix presents the game statistics for sidekicks, of which there are three types:

**Expert**, an agile and exceedingly helpful jack of all trades

**Spellcaster**, a magic-user who can cast spells to harm your foes or heal you and your friends

**Warrior**, a martial companion who specializes in striking your foes or defending you and your allies

The DM will either tell you which type of sidekick to use or let you choose one. It's up to you and the DM to decide who controls the sidekick in play.

## Sidekick Stat Blocks

A sidekick's game statistics are presented in a box called a stat block, which is essentially a mini character sheet. A stat block contains things like ability scores and hit points, as well as the actions a sidekick is most likely to take in combat. Like any character, a sidekick can use the action options in the combat section of chapter 2.

These stat blocks work with any character race. If you and the DM agree, you may enhance your sidekick with the appropriate racial traits from chapter 1.

For more information on stat blocks, see the "Creatures" section.

- [Expert](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/expert-esk.md)  
- [Warrior](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/warrior-esk.md)  

## Proficiencies

A sidekick is proficient with any armor, weapons, and tools included in its stat block. In addition, **experts** are proficient with simple weapons, rapiers, shortswords, and light armor; **spellcasters** are proficient with simple weapons and light armor; and **warriors** are proficient with simple and martial weapons, shields, and all armor.

## Sidekick Level

Your sidekick starts as a 1st-level character. As you and your sidekick adventure together, your sidekick gains experience points and reaches new levels the same way a player character does, using the rules in chapter 1.

When a sidekick gains a level, look at the sidekick's table below, and consult the new level's row, which shows the sidekick's new hit point maximum and features.

The DM may start a sidekick at a level higher than 1st, using the hit point maximum for its level on the appropriate table below. Also, give the sidekick the features for its current level and any earlier levels on that table.
