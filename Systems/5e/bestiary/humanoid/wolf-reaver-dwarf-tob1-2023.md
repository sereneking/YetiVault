# Wolf Reaver Dwarf
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 412*  

Like his totem, the wolf reaver dwarf travels in a pack with its brothers in arms, looking for worthy challenges to prove its combat prowess. Rushing into battle beside its allies for glory as much as plunder, the wolf reaver dwarf throws caution to the wind and fights without care for its own safety.
