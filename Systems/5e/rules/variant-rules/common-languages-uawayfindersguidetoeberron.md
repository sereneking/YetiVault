# Common Languages
*Source: Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 40* 

Common is the language of the Five Nations. The Mror dwarves speak Dwarvish and the Aereni elves speak Elvish, but they know Common as the language of trade. In Eberron, there are a number of other languages that serve this role in different regions or cultures. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC to reflect this.

Giant is the common tongue of Xen'drik. It is rarely encountered on Khorvaire. Monsters in Khorvaire usually speak Goblin.

Goblin is the common tongue of Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches, along with most "monstrous" creatures in Khorvaire. It was the language of the goblin empire that dominated the continent before humanity arrived. Orcish is a dead language; it may be encountered in ancient inscriptions, but modern orcs speak Goblin.

Infernal is spoken by spirits that embody evil. This incorporates Abyssal; all fiends speak a common language. Infernal is sometimes called "Khyber's speech," while Celestial is "the tongue of Siberys."

Riedran is the common tongue of the continent of Sarlona. Quori is spoken by the kalashtar, spirits native to Dal Quor, and the Inspired lords of Riedra.
