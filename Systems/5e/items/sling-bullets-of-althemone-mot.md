# Sling Bullets of Althemone
*Ammunition, very rare*  


The sling bullets come in a pouch, which contains `1d4 + 4` bullets. Roll on the Magic Sling Bullets table for each bullet to determine its magical property.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with each of these bullets. If a bullet misses its target, the bullet teleports back into the pouch. Once a bullet hits a target, the bullet loses its magic.
