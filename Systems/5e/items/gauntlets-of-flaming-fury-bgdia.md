# Gauntlets of Flaming Fury
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)*  


While you wear both of these steel gauntlets, any non-magical weapon you grasp with either gauntlet is treated as a magic weapon. As a bonus action, you can use the gauntlets to cause magical flames to envelop one or two melee weapons in your grasp. Each flaming weapon deals an extra `1d6` fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you sheath or let go of either weapon. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
