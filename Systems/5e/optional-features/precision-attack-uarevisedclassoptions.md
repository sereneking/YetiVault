# Precision Attack
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 3*  

When you make a weapon attack against a creature, you can expend one superiority die, roll it, and add it to the attack roll. You can use this ability before or after rolling the `d20`, but before any of the effects of the attack are applied.
