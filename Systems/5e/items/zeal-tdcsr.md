# Zeal
*Illegal Drug, unknown*  

- **Cost**: 150 gp

Distilled from the ichor of demons, [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) was originally used by Tal'Dorei's ancient berserkers to grant them incredible strength and courage before battles. These days, it's most commonly used by criminal bruisers before a brawl. Most modern warriors stay well away from [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md), due both to its addictive nature and to the mental and physical degeneration it can cause over long periods of time. When prepared properly, [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) is a purple, ashy-tasting gel that typically costs 150 gp per dose.

After slathering [zeal](/Systems/5e/items/zeal-tdcsr.md) across your exposed skin as an action, you must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, you become [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for `1d4` rounds as your muscles lock up. On a success, your weapon attacks deal an additional `1d6` damage for the next minute. After this effect ends, you gain one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion).
