**Nyxborn Traits**

`dice: [](nyxborn-statistics-nyxborn-traits-mot.md#^nyxborn-traits)`

| dice: d6 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Magic Resistance**. The creature's Nyxborn nature gives it advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. |
| 2 | **Light Sensitivity**. A creature of the night sky, the Nyxborn has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight, while it is in bright light. |
| 3 | **Immutable Form**. The Nyxborn creature is the philosophical ideal of its kind. It is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. |
| 4 | **Magic Weapons**. The Nyxborn creature's weapon attacks are magical. |
| 5 | **Nyx Step**. The Nyxborn can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. |
| 6 | **Starlight Form**. The Nyxborn glows with the soft light of the night sky, shedding dim light in a 15-foot radius. |
