# Skeleton Rifler

## Salvage

Firearms recovered from skeleton troopers are nonfunctional, but parts of them might be useful. Each firearm recovered can reduce the cost of making a similar firearm by 10 percent, up to 50 percent.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** Necromancers with advanced training and hefty resources can make skeletons that are linked in death to their firearms.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** A commander leads some platoons of skeleton troopers. This skeleton directs the attacks and enhances the efficiency of its undead underlings.  

> [!note] GM Advice
> 
> Skeletal troopers are effective when used as minions in the army of a higher-level threat. Cinematic battles focused on sieges or large battles are perfect for troopers. In these cases, having the troopers immune to turning until their powerful leader is defeated prevents anticlimactic encounters.
