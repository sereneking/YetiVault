| dice: d8 | Calamity |
|----------|----------|
| 1 | Sigil begins to shudder daily at peak and antipeak, causing a citywide panic. |
| 2 | Waves of arcane blackouts sweep across Sigil. During these events, magic items have their effects suppressed, spells behave unpredictably, and portals cease to function. The "Incanterium" is to blame. |
| 3 | Without warning, the Lady of Pain sends two-thirds of Sigil's population to "the Mazes". It's up to the characters to figure out why. |
| 4 | Reliable portals throughout Sigil begin to malfunction. Chaos ensues as citizens vanish to unknown planes in a mass. |
| 5 | A portal to the front lines of the Blood War opens in the "Lower Ward", bringing the conflict to the city. |
| 6 | Dozens of dead factions unite in "Undersigil". They mount an uprising on the surface and attempt to oust several factions. |
| 7 | The Lady of Pain locks the Cage without warning, barring anything and anyone from entering or exiting the City of Doors. |
| 8 | The Lady of Pain decrees that Sigil tolerates its factions no longer. They must disband or risk her wrath. Three factols come together and hire the characters to change the Lady's mind. |
