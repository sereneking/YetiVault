# Reborn
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 20*  

- **Ability Scores**: Choose one of: (a) Choose any +2, choose any other +1; (b) Choose any +1, choose any other +1, choose any other +1
- **Size**: Small or Medium
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

## Traits

### Size

You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you gain this lineage.

### Ancestral Legacy

If you replace a race with this lineage, you can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it.

If you don't keep any of those elements or you choose this lineage at character creation, you gain proficiency in two skills of your choice.

### Deathless Nature

You have escaped death, a fact represented by the following benefits:

- You have advantage on saving throws against disease and being [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned), and you have resistance to poison damage.  
- You have advantage on death saving throws.  
- You don't need to eat, drink, or breathe.  
- You don't need to sleep, and magic can't put you to sleep. You can finish a long rest in 4 hours if you spend those hours in an inactive, motionless state, during which you retain consciousness.  

### Knowledge from a Past Life

You temporarily remember glimpses of the past, perhaps faded memories from ages ago or a previous life. When you make an ability check that uses a skill, you can roll a `d6` immediately after seeing the number on the `d20` and add the number on the `d6` to the check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Description

Death isn't always the end. The reborn exemplify this, being individuals who have died yet, somehow, still live. Some reborn exhibit the scars of fatal ends, their ashen flesh or bloodless veins making it clear that they've been touched by death. Other reborn are marvels of magic or science, being stitched together from disparate beings or bearing mysterious minds in manufactured bodies. Whatever their origins, reborn know a new life and seek experiences and answers all their own.

### Faded Memories

Reborn suffer from some manner of discontinuity, an interruption of their lives or physical state that their minds are ill equipped to deal with. Their memories of events before this interruption are often vague or absent. Occasionally, the most unexpected experiences might cause sensations or visions of the past to come rushing back.

Rather than sleeping, reborn regularly sit and dwell on the past, hoping for some revelation of what came before. Most of the time, these are dark, silent stretches. Occasionally, though, in a moment of peace, stress, or excitement, a reborn gains a glimpse of what came before. When you desire to have such a dreamlike vision, roll on the Lost Memories table to inspire its details.

| 4 | A memory brings with it the voice of someone once close to you. How do they advise you? |
| 5 | You recall enjoying something that you can't stand doing now. What is it? Why don't you like it now? |
| 6 | A memory carries a vivid smell or sensation. What are you going to do to recreate that experience? |
