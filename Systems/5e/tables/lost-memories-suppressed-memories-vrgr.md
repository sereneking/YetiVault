| dice: d6 | Memory |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | You're paralyzed on a cold table. Clicking sounds surround you. Pallid tentacles slither toward your face, each ending in gleaming surgical instruments. What are they trying to do? |
| 2 | Some unfamiliar reflex moves your arm. Looking, you catch a glimpse of a bruise slithering beneath your skin. What do you do? |
| 3 | A many-legged, ferret-like creature floats into your cell. You feel multitudes of unseen eyes upon you. What do your captors expect you to do with this? What do you do? |
| 4 | Rainbow storms assail the heights of a mountain so tall it seems to curve over you. You're floating over a red wasteland, just one in a line of hovering beings. What do you see ahead? |
| 5 | You knew a stranger. You were each other's comfort against fear and pain. Then they were taken away. What were their final words to you? |
| 6 | The figure hovering before you is deemed acceptable. They're lowered into a pool, where pale, slug-like beings set upon them. You float forward. Why are you deemed unacceptable? |
