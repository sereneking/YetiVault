# Baalzebul

## Lair actions
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Baalzebul can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Baalzebul can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Baalzebul casts his innate hold monster.  
- Baalzebul emits slime in a 5-foot radius centered on him. Any creature that starts their turn standing in this slime is considered [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) and must use their action to succeed on DC 17 Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check to break free.  
- Baalzebul uses half his burrow speed to dig into the ground. He gains half-cover when buried 10 feet and three-quarters cover when at 20 feet.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Baalzebul's lair is corrupted by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Within 1 mile of Baalzebul's lair, stinking piles of filth accumulate as if from nowhere. The entire area is covered with garbage and feces and is treated as difficult terrain.  
- Within 2 miles of the lair, the air is filled with buzzing flies. Any creature that finishes a short or long rest in this area must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or derive no benefit from the rest.  

If Baalzebul dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
