Centuries ago, "Zan Tal'Dorei" defeated "King Trist Drassig" in the "Battle of Umbra Hills". "Drassig" died wielding a blade called Graz'tchar, gifted to him by a cunning demon among the ranks of the fiends granted to him by the Strife Emperor. Zan let "Drassig's" blade lie where it fell, along with his body.

This blade contains a sliver of the ego of the Demon Prince of Indulgence, and enacts his anarchic, hedonistic will upon the world. From up to one thousand miles away from its resting place in the "Umbra Hills", the voice of [Graz'tchar](/Systems/5e/items/graztchar-the-decadent-end-tdcsr.md) can be heard faintly in the minds of those it reaches out toâ€”and, so it is said, only one who has heard the voice of the blade can find it amidst the blackened crags of that accursed battlefield.

[The Decadent End](/Systems/5e/items/graztchar-the-decadent-end-tdcsr.md) is willing to grant power to those who accept it, even from afar. It prefers to test those who hear its call before leading them to find it. When the time comes that someone does wield Graz'tchar once more, its game statistics are [on page 195](/Systems/5e/items/graztchar-the-decadent-end-tdcsr.md).
