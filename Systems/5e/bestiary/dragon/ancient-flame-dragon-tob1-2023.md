# Ancient Flame Dragon
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 117*  

*The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw*.Flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. "May you be the fire's plaything" is a curse often used by the foolish.

## Taunting Others

The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasureâ€”direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler's ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.

## Malevolent Purpose

The results of a flame dragon's schemes are secondary to the enjoyment it derives from pursuing a nebulous and ever-changing goal. Some flame dragons spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon's land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into dire insults. The vengeance itself is secondary to an excuse for hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge. Each is a delightful hobby. Any disruption in their game kindles a terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.

## Fond of Souvenirs

Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.

## Vengeful Brethren

Nothing is safe from a flame dragon's scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon's undivided attention for generations. Wiser still, is to remove all trace of involvement in a flame dragon's death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.

## A Flame Dragon's Lair

Flame dragons dwell near ever-burning fires: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, it must serve as a showcase for all the dragon's trophies. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the area, sometimes protected behind crystal walls. This display feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and it serves as a lure for adventurers. Many of these lairs also feature a huge, reflective surface, as a flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.

## Traits

***Fire Incarnate.*** Creatures with resistance to fire damage don't have resistance to the fire damage dealt by the flame dragon. A creature with immunity to fire damage is still immune to the dragon's fire damage.

***Heated Body.*** A creature that touches the flame dragon or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 14 (`4d6`) fire damage.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon uses its Frightful Presence. It then makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) fire damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (`26d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature in that area must also succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or go on a rampage for 1 minute. A rampaging creature must attack the nearest creature other than the dragon on its turn. If no other creature is near enough to move to and attack, the rampaging creature stalks off in a random direction, seeking a target for its rage. The rampaging creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Bonus Actions

***Shifting Flames.*** The dragon magically transforms into a Gargantuan or smaller fire-based Elemental (such as a salamander, magma mephit, or fire elemental) or back into its true form, which is a Dragon. Without wings or other way of flying, it loses its flying speed. Its statistics, other than its size and speed, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying transforms with it. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a Tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (`2d6 + 6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
