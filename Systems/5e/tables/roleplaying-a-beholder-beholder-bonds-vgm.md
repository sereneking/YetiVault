| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | My followers are all spying on me, and I seek motivated, powerful allies to destroy them. |
| 2 | I miss the kinship of my identical twin, who disappeared years ago. |
| 3 | I must recover an artifact that was stolen from me. |
| 4 | I have foreseen the moment of my death and know what will kill me. I hope to curry favor with my slayer to forestall my end. |
| 5 | I was lucky to escape my enemy, and I worry that I might be discovered again before I am ready. |
| 6 | I scheme endlessly to recover an ancient tome that contains the secret of creating perfect, obedient clones of myself. |
