# Bursting Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses p. 3*  

You imbue your arrow with a blast of force energy drawn from the school of evocation. If the arrow hits a creature, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it takes `2d6` force damage.

The force damage increases to `4d6` when you reach 18th level with this class.
