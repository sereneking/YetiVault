# Lichen Lich
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 223*  

Lichen liches are undead remnants of powerful druids.

A lichen lich looks like a skeleton covered with fungi and bark-like lichen. A lichen lich has vines within its chest cavity. These vines exude viscid and poisonous black fluid.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the lich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Rejuvenation.*** If it has a phylactery, a destroyed lich gains a new body in `1d10` days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the phylactery.

***Spellcasting.*** The lich casts one of the following spells using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability (save DC 19):

**At will**: [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md)

**1/day each**: [antilife shell](/Systems/5e/spells/antilife-shell.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [speak with plants](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-plants.md), [transport via plants](/Systems/5e/spells/transport-via-plants.md), 

**3/day each**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [fog cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/fog-cloud.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lich makes four attacks.

***Poisonous Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 17 (`5d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Wither.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+9` to hit, range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage.

***Fire Storm (7th-Level Spell; 1/Day).*** The lich fills up to ten 10-foot cubes with fire. Every cube must be within 150 feet of the lich and occupy a space the lich can see, and each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 38 (`7d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If the lich chooses, plant life in the area is unaffected by the spell.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** The lich makes an attack.

***Poison Prick (Cost 2 Actions).*** The lich targets one [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) until the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition ends on it.

***Sap Life (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (`2d10`) necrotic damage. The lich regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of damage that the creature takes.
