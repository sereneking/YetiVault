|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A retainer who died recently shows up again, as if nothing happened and with no memory of having "died," or of the events immediately preceding their supposed demise. |
| 2 | Agents of the Chamber show up intent on murdering the characters, because their recent actions have unwittingly been at the behest of a Lord of Dust and have twisted a portion of the Prophecy. |
| 3 | A trusted mentor changes their tune abruptly and begins sending the characters on unusual tasks. |
| 4 | Everyone the characters used to deal with in town suddenly acts as if they've never seen the characters before. |
| 5 | Increasingly vicious fiends attack the camp every few nights. |
| 6 | Agents of a Lord of Dust apologetically kidnap a character's loved one, politely requesting that the character perform a series of favors to secure the hostage's release. |
