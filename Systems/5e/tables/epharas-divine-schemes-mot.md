|----------|--------|
| 1 | Ephara tries to curry Karametra's favor, hoping to persuade her to use her influence over agriculture to help the cities under Ephara's protection flourish. But Karametra, as the patron of Setessa, thinks that Ephara's focus on cities is dangerous and damaging to the lands. Nylea lashes out at both Karametra and Ephara, believing them to be working together. |
| 2 | Ephara attempts to strip Phenax of his "stolen" divinity, outraged by his influence over criminals. |
| 3 | A recent earthquake has changed the coastline, exposing a new island with a verdant and lush landscape. Ephara and Nylea are locked in a battle for control over the island, with Nylea wanting it to remain wilderness and Ephara seeking to build a city on the fertile ground. |
| 4 | Ephara sends champions to free a city from the control of tyrants who worship Mogis, god of wrath. Mogis retaliates by sending his armies to attack a city under Ephara's protection. |
