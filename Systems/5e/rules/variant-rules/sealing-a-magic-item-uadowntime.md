# Sealing a Magic Item
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 12* 

Selling a magic item is by no means an easy task. Con artists and thieves are always looking out for an easy score, and there's no guarantee that a character will receive a good offer even if a legitimate buyer is found.

## Resources

Finding a buyer for one of your magic items requires one workweek of work and 100 gp in expenses, spent to spread word of the sale. You must pick one item at a time to sell.

## Resolution

A character who wants to sell an item must make a Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check to determine what kind of offer comes in. The character can always opt to not sell, instead wasting the workweek and trying again later. Use the Magic Item Base Prices and Magic Item Offer tables to determine the sale price.

**Magic Item Base Prices**

| Rarity | Base Price |
|--------|------------|
| Common | 50 gp |
| Uncommon | 200 gp |
| Rare | 2,000 gp |
| Very rare | 10,000 gp |
| Legendary | 25,000 gp |

**Magic Item Offer**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–10 | 50% of base price |
| 11–20 | 100% of base price |
| 21+ | 150% of base price |

## Complications

The greatest risk in selling a magic item lies in attracting thieves, tricksters, and anyone else who wants the item but doesn't want to pay for it. Other folk might try to undermine a deal in order to bolster their own business or seek to discredit the characters as legitimate sellers.
