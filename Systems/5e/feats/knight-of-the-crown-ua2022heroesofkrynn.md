# Knight of the Crown
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Crown, a group that extols the virtues of cooperation, loyalty, and obedience. You excel in group combat and gain these benefits:

- **Tactical Teamwork.** When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll against another creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to grant advantage on the attack roll. You can use this reaction a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  

> [!note] Membership in Multiple Knightly Orders
> 
> Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.
