**Eberron Crafting Complications**

`dice: [](eberron-crafting-complications-erlw.md#^eberron-crafting-complications)`

| dice: d6 | Complication |
|----------|--------------|
| 1 | House Cannith or another dragonmarked house takes an interest in your work. Do they view you as a threat, or are they impressed by your techniques? |
| 2 | A mishap creates a temporary manifest zone (see ""The Planes of Existence"" in "chapter 4" for information on manifest zones). |
| 3 | You need to acquire an additional rare component to complete your work. Time for adventure! |
| 4 | The shifting balance of the planes interferes with your work; you must wait for the current planar alignment to change. This delays your work by `2d6` days. |
| 5 | Your efforts draw the attention of the Aurum, the Chamber, the Emerald Claw, or the Lords of Dust. |
| 6 | Your item becomes sentient (see chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on sentient items). |
