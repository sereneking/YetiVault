# Rebuke of the Talisman
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 12*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Talisman

When the wearer of your talisman is hit by an attacker you can see within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to deal psychic damage to the attacker equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1 damage) and push it up to 10 feet away from the talisman's wearer.
