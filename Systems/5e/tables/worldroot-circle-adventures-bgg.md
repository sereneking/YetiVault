| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Giants of the Worldroot Circle need smaller adventurers to brave the caves beneath their world tree to stop whatever is gnawing or corrupting its roots. |
| 2 | A druid who saw the root of the world in a vision hires adventurers for protection on a pilgrimage to the site, which is guarded by the Worldroot Circle. |
| 3 | Long ago, the Worldroot Circle helped seal portals where invaders from another plane broke through. Now one of those portals has reopened, and the characters must find giants to reseal it. |
| 4 | Multiple oracles see visions of a great evil entering the world through a portal at its root, so adventurers are sent to find the place and ensure the portal doesn't open. They arrive to find giants of the Worldroot Circle locked in a losing battle to hold back the evil. |
| 5 | The characters find a magic staff made from a branch of a world tree, but the staff gives its owner haunting dreams that echo the Worldroot Circle's rites. |
| 6 | A giant of the Worldroot Circle comes to a city and insists a portal to the Far Realm has opened somewhere inside. Adventurers are tasked with helping the giant find and seal the portal. |
