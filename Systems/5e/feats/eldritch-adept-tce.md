# Eldritch Adept
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything p. 79*  

**Prerequisite**: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

Studying occult lore, you learn one [Eldritch Invocation](/Systems/5e/optional-features/list-eldritch-invocation.md) option of your choice from the warlock class. Your spellcasting ability for the invocation is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat). If the invocation has a prerequisite of any kind, you can choose that invocation only if you're a warlock who meets the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the invocation with another one from the warlock class.
