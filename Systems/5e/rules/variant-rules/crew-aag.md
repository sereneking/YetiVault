# Crew
*Source: Astral Adventurer's Guide p. 24* 

The standard crew complement for a spelljamming ship includes one captain to give orders, one spelljammer to pilot the ship, and one or more crew members to operate its weapons. Some ships carry extra crew (such as troops and back-up spelljammers) or passengers. A ship that has more than a standard crew complement will degrade the quality of its air supply more quickly.

A spellcaster typically charges at least 50 gp per day to operate a [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md).
