## Traits

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, Grumink has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Grumink scores against a [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Grumink is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Grumink instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** Grumink deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Grumink that isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and Grumink doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Grumink makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (`7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (`7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
