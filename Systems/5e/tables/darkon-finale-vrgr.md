**Darkon Finale**

`dice: [](darkon-finale-vrgr.md#^darkon-finale)`

| dice: d6 | Finale |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | None of Azalin's would-be inheritors are fit to become Darklord. Only by merging their spirits or making one inheritor the vessel for a hidden evil can a new Darklord arise. |
| 2 | The King's Tear is a dungeon-sized amber chrysalis that Azalin is using to create a new Dark Power. The characters must find the black shadow dragon Ebbasheyth and convince her to help infiltrate the floating construction and shatter it from within. |
| 3 | Azalin believes the only way to escape the Domains of Dread is by shattering their linchpin: the first domain, Barovia. He has escaped Darkon, but the next stage of his scheme must be stopped before he destroys all the domains. |
| 4 | Each of Azalin's inheritors holds a piece of the Darklord's crown. Claiming the pieces and bringing them to Castle Avernus allows Azalin's restoration or a new Darklord's ascension. |
| 5 | One of the characters is a clone of Azalin, created as a potential Darklord so the real Azalin could escape. The Hour of Ascension was a distraction to mislead the Dark Powers. |
| 6 | Azalin changed time so he never became a Darklord. The characters must follow Azalin into his past and ensure his deeds attract the Dark Powers' notice. |
