# Whistle-Stick
*Instrument, unknown*  


The [grung](/Systems/5e/races/grung-oga.md) of "One Grung Above" are trained to use this new musical instrument. This is a hollow tube with holes cut throughout, much like a flute. You can play music with it for entertainment, but the grung also swing it about by a sturdy cord (attached) to create a sound recognizable by other grung, so they know each other's approximate location. Additionally, grung that know Thieves' Cant can use a whistle stick in this manner to communicate over distance.
