**Underground Quirks**

`dice: [](underground-quirks-bgg.md#^underground-quirks)`

| dice: d6 | Quirk |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | You've seen few colors, instead primarily experiencing the world in shades of black and white. |
| 2 | Your eyes lack pigment and appear translucent. |
| 3 | You vaguely recall a phenomenon called "rain," during which fresh water fell from above. |
| 4 | Your ears are used to the echo of empty caverns, and the bustling noises of the surface are distracting for you. |
| 5 | The idea of a space with no ceiling terrifies you. |
| 6 | You're desperate to touch a cloud. You don't know what it will feel like, but you hope it's fluffy. |
