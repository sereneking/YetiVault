| 1 | An aging dwarf—a retired general and an Aurum Concordian—collects unusual constructs, hoping to find a way to transfer his mind into a superior body. |
| 2 | An Aurum Concordian is renowned for having the finest arcane library in Khorvaire. Adventurers might help them collect more tome, but when a number of prominent wizards are murdered and their research goes missing, is the Concordian to blame? |
| 3 | A member of the Gold Concord is on the run from the Aurum after learning a terrible secret. |
| 4 | An imprisoned Concordian mobilizes a network of contacts and well-placed Aurum members in order to secure their own release. |
