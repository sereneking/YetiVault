Avian demons called hazvongels haunt the windswept skies of Pandemonium, preying on lost and weary travelers. Hazvongels resemble enormous, crimson crows with tattered feathers and a dozen legs. Their wings constantly drip blood, which they gather in their many talons and fling in a gruesome rain.

Hazvongels sometimes soar in the skies of the Abyss, where they originate, but they migrate to and from Pandemonium throughout their existence. More powerful demons, especially the demon lord Pazuzu, use hazvongels as scouts, but hazvongels' wanderlust makes them ill-suited for extended missions.
