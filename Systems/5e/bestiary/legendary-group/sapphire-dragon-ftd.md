# Sapphire Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Awesome Thunder.** A thunderous detonation of sound that can be heard up to 300 feet away surrounds one creature in the lair that the dragon can see. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 13 (`3d8`) thunder damage and be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.  
- **Beguiling Whisper.** The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.  
- **Stone Passage.** The dragon touches a section of stone up to 30 feet in any dimension. The dragon can shape the stone to open or close a passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 10 feet thick.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region surrounding a legendary sapphire dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Crystal Profusion.** Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and veins of sapphire gemstones, particularly underground.  
- **Stony Sight.** Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair is a conduit for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any natural stone formation in that region.  
- **Telepathic Enhancement.** The dragon's psionic energy enhances the mental powers of other creatures. Any creature capable of telepathic communication has its telepathy range doubled while within 1 mile of the lair. This includes creatures with innate telepathy and magical telepathy such as the [Rary's telepathic bond](/Systems/5e/spells/rarys-telepathic-bond.md) spell.  
- **Thriving Wildlife.** [Giant spiders](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) (a sapphire dragon's favorite prey) are attracted to the area within 6 miles of the lair and settle there in large numbers.  

If the dragon dies, the population of giant spiders in the region returns to normal levels over the course of `1d10` days. The enhancement of telepathic abilities ends immediately. The existing abundance of crystals and sapphires remains, but new ones form at a normal rate.
