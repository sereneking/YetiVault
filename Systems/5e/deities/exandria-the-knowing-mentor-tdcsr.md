Revered by seers, sages, and teachers of all walks of life, the Knowing Mentor guided the growth of civilization throughout the "Age of Arcanum" like sunlight guides the branches of a tree. Her teachings were silenced when she was grievously wounded by the Chained Oblivion during the "Calamity", and though she survived and went into hiding behind the Divine Gate, her followers are hunted by agents of her ancient foes to this day. Her devout now worship in private, spreading knowledge, philosophy, and lore anonymously through traceless channels.

The one exception are the scholars of the "Cobalt Soul", an international organization of knowledge-seekers, spies, and archivists that seek to reveal the truth at all costs. Most members of the "Cobalt Soul" aren't zealous worshipers of the Knowing Mentor, but still pay homage to her in some form.

## Depiction

Common representations show the Knowing Mentor as a greying, mature woman of welcoming, matronly smile swathed in billowing robes and scarves that fan into books and scrolls. Some call her the Knowing Mistress, revering her as a headmistress of knowledge among the gods.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Knowing Mentor's clerics are granted powers of Arcana, Knowledge, or Twilight.

## Holy Day

The Knowing Mentor has no public holy day, for her public worship was shattered during the "Calamity", and she has since fallen into half-remembered myth. Only in "Emon" has the Knowing Mentor's faith been publicly resurrectedâ€”though her worship by the intellectuals of the city bears little resemblance to that of the knowledge-seekers of old.

- Unmask those who would destroy the Knowing Mentor. Learn their secrets and unveil them to the world.  
- Uphold and teach the importance of reason, perception, and truth in guiding one's emotions and path.  
- Condemn those who lie without moral cause, for evil folk gain power when their followers obscure the truth. Never stoop to the level of selfish liars.
