# Ancient Deep Crow

## Regional effects
_Source: Acquisitions Incorporated_

The region containing an ancient deep crow's lair is transformed by the creature's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Supernatural shadow turns all bright light to dim light in underground regions within 6 miles of the lair.  
- Intermittent, echoing caws can be heard coming from all directions within 6 miles of the lair.  
- Subterranean beasts within 1 mile of the ancient deep crow's lair serve as the creature's eyes and ears, alerting it to the presence of intruders and making it all but impossible to surprise the ancient deep crow.  

If the ancient deep crow dies, these effects fade immediately.
