# Unarmed Fighting
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 13*  

Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to `1d6` + your Strength modifier. If you strike with two free hands, the `d6` becomes a `d8`.

When you successfully start a grapple, you can deal `1d4` bludgeoning damage to the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) creature. Until the grapple ends, you can also deal this damage to the creature whenever you hit it with a melee attack.
