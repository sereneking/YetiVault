# Scribing a Spell Scroll
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 12* 

With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a [spell scroll](/Systems/5e/items/spell-scroll.md). This activity represents the time and effort it takes to produce such an item.

## Resources

Scribing a [spell scroll](/Systems/5e/items/spell-scroll.md) takes time and money based on the level of the spell you wish to scribe, as shown in the [Spell Scroll](/Systems/5e/items/spell-scroll.md) Costs table. You must also provide any material components required by the spell. Moreover, you must have the spell prepared or among your known spells in order to scribe a scroll of it, and you must have proficiency in the [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill.

If you scribe a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster is 1st level.

**Spell Scroll Costs**

| Level | Cost | Time |
|-------|------|------|
| Cantrip | 15 gp | 1 day |
| 1st | 25 gp | 2 days |
| 2nd | 250 gp | 2 workweeks |
| 3rd | 500 gp | 4 workweeks |
| 4th | 2,500 gp | 6 workweeks |
| 5th | 5,000 gp | 8 workweeks |
| 6th | 15,000 gp | 12 workweeks |
| 7th | 25,000 gp | 24 workweeks |
| 8th | 50,000 gp | 48 workweeks |
| 9th | 250,000 gp | 96 workweeks |

## Complications

Crafting a scroll is a solitary task, unlikely to attract much attention. The complications that arise are more likely to involve the preparation needed to scribe a scroll.
