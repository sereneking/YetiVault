# Sitri Cat
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 85*  

Disease is no stranger to the people of Etharis. The virulent Weeping Pox has devastated towns and families, and the Tears of the Hungerer is rumored to be a poison designed by necromancers. Other afflictions, such as the Seven Shades of Sitri and the Faith Cough, are not deadly but can impede even the strongest body. These diseases can be carried by animals, breaking their normal method of transmission. A twist of nature or foul magic has created carriers, some intentionally and some aggressively, that spread sickness quickly.

## Traits

***Keen Smell.*** The Sitri cat has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on smell.

***Seven Shades of Sitri.*** A humanoid who touches a Sitri cat must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the Seven Shades of Sitri. If a humanoid succeeds on the saving throw, they're immune to the disease for 24 hours. Carnal urges overwhelm an infected humanoid. When the infected interacts with another non-hostile humanoid, the infected becomes [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by that humanoid until the subject of the infatuation or their friends harm the infected. The infected can repeat the saving throw once every 24 hours. Current infatuations end when one of these saves succeeds. The disease ends for the infected when they have succeeded on five saving throws.

## Actions

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 1 slashing damage and Seven Shades of Sitri.
