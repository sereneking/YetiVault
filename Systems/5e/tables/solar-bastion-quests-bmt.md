| dice: d8 | Quest |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Aid and Counsel. Your contact has learned another group of adventurers has discovered a [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Find them before they draw from it, and warn them of its dangersâ€”or help them get out of the mess their draws bring upon them. |
| 2 | Research. A rare tome said to describe early encounters with Decks of Many Things is thought to lie in the hoard of a dragon. Retrieve it! |
| 3 | Track Rifflers. [Rifflers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/riffler-bmt.md) (see "chapter 21") have been active in a remote countryside. Find out if they have a [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md), and ensure they don't give it to a hapless mortal. |
| 4 | Stay Ahead of the Grim Harrow. Riders of the Grim Harrow (see "chapter 19") are terrorizing a village as they search for a [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Figure out where they're going, and get there before they do! |
| 5 | Find [Euryale](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md). Rumors of a reclusive medusa are spreading through a city. There's a slim chance the medusa could be [Euryale](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/euryale-bmt.md), who could lead the knights to [Asteria](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md). Determine the medusa's identity and secretly follow her trail, if any, to [Asteria](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/asteria-bmt.md). |
| 6 | Prevent Misuse. A [hierophant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/hierophant-of-the-comet-bmt.md) of the Heralds of the Comet (see "chapter 12") has acquired a few cards from the original [Deck of Many Things](/Systems/5e/items/deck-of-many-things.md). Ensure the complete artifact doesn't fall into her hands. |
| 7 | Combat a Curse. After plundering a dragon's hoard, adventurers attract constant ill luck. Make sure the treasure isn't cursed; if it is, ensure they aren't spreading the curse as they spend the gold. |
| 8 | Contain an Evil Artifact. The blights and ruination befalling a region suggest someone there is casting spells from the [Book of Vile Darkness](/Systems/5e/items/book-of-vile-darkness.md) or perhaps wielding the [Wand of Orcus](/Systems/5e/items/wand-of-orcus.md). Do whatever is necessary to stop this person, and bring the evil artifact back to Hilarion so it can be contained. |
