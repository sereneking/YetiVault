The pillar of justice, protection, nobility, and honor, the Platinum Dragon is a beacon to paladins of order and good, and is revered by most metallic dragons as the first of their kind. The crest of the Platinum Dragon adorns many halls of high leadership and judgment, invoking his will in all matters of justice. To follow him is to look after those who cannot look after themselves.

## Depiction

The Platinum Dragon is often seen emblazoned on shields and armor, both functional and decorative, in the form of a brilliant silver dragon head in profile. Temples and works of art depict a massive, glittering dragon with vibrant platinum scales and a wingspan that fades into etherealness.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Platinum Dragon's clerics are granted powers of Life, Order, or War.

## Holy Day

The Platinum Dragon's holy day is called Embertide and is celebrated on the fifth day of the eleventh month. This is a day of remembrance, solemnity, and respect for those who have fallen in the defense of others.

- Stand as a paragon of honor and justice.  
- Smite evil wherever it is found, yet show compassion to those who have strayed from righteousness.  
- Defend the weak, bring freedom to the persecuted, and protect the ideals of justice and order.
