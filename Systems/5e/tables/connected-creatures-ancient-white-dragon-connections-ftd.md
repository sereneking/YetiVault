|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A [death knight](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/death-knight.md) and an [ancient white dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) swap tales of old foes and unanswered grievances, nursing the hunger for vengeance that sustains them. |
| 2 | An [ancient white dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) makes intermittent assaults against a mated pair of [adult silver dragons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-silver-dragon.md) who lair nearby. |
| 3 | An [ancient white dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) guards a [lich's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/lich.md) phylactery, keeping it sealed in a tomb of ice. The lich visits periodically, bearing fabulous treasures as payment. |
| 4 | A community of orcs believe an [ancient white dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-white-dragon.md) to be the reincarnation of a legendary leader. They've been venerating the dragon so long that the dragon now believes the story and speaks proudly in Orc about the orcs' triumphs. |
