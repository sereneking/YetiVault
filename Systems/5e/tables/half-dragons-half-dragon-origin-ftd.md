**Half-Dragon Origin**

`dice: [](half-dragons-half-dragon-origin-ftd.md#^half-dragon-origin)`

| dice: d6 | Origin |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Regional Effects**. The magical influence of a dragon's lair causes half-dragons to spontaneously arise among the area's other creatures. |
| 2 | **Forbidden Fruit**. A dragon can cause a particular tree to produce magical fruit. When eaten by a creature able to bear children, the fruit causes the creature to bear a half-dragon. |
| 3 | **True Love's Gift**. Love occasionally blossoms between dragons and creatures of other kinds, and this life bond can result in half-dragon children. Most half-dragons born of love are created as a magical gift. |
| 4 | **Blood Transformation**. A creature that bathes in or drinks the blood of a dragon can sometimes be transformed into a half-dragon. A dragon might voluntarily offer some blood to bring this about, or it could happen accidentally when a would-be dragonslayer is splashed with dragon blood. |
| 5 | **Cradle Favor**. A dragon might bestow the gift of draconic power on a newborn baby or an unborn childâ€”as either a blessing or a curse. |
| 6 | **Hoard Thieves**. The hoard of an older dragon is imbued with that dragon's power. Those who steal from such a hoard might transform into half-dragons as that power leaches into them. |
