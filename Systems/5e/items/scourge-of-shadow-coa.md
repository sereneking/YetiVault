Said to be a gift to Glasya from Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow is a multi-headed whip constructed from infernal iron. The scourge is nigh-in- destructible, and Glasya carries it with her wherever she goes. When she wields the whip in battle, it shrouds her in an aura of shadow.

The Scourge of Shadow is a magic whip. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it does `3d4` slashing damage instead of its regular damage. When you hit a good aligned creature with it, that creatures takes an extra `4d4` necrotic damage.

Whenever an unattuned creature attacks with the weapon, it deals `2d4` necrotic damage, ignoring resistances and immunities, to them, but otherwise functions normally.

## Random Properties

The Scourge of Shadow has the following random properties:

- 2 [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 1 [major beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property  
- 2 [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) properties  
- 1 [major detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-major-detrimental-properties.md) property  

## Keen

The whip scores a critical on a roll of 18, 19, or 20. When it scores a critical, its damage dice are upgraded to `3d6` instead of `3d4` for the duration of the attack. If attacking a good aligned creature, or attacking with the weapon unattuned, the necrotic damage dice are also increased to a `d6` instead of a `d4`.

## Fast Reflexes

While attuned to the Scourge of Shadow, you gain advantage on initiative rolls, and you add your Charisma and Dexterity modifiers to the roll. You may use either your Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls (the same modifier must be used for both attack and damage).

## Veil of Shadow

You're protected by a field of shadow that makes you resistant to radiant and necrotic damage. While in dim light or darkness you gain [blindsight](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#blindsight) out to 60 feet and Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks are made with advantage.

## Destroying the Scourge

Though the process is known only to Glasya and Asmodeus, the Scourge of Shadow can be destroyed. It must be taken to the Pit of Fire in Phlegethos. The scourge, along with the body of an archdevil, must be thrown into the Hellfire together. As they hit the flames, a spell of Darkness must be cast at 9th level on the scourge. If each part of the ritual is performed correctly, the whip disintegrates within the Hellfire.
