> Curiosity is an itch that must be scratched.

The humans of Kaladesh are a race full of passionate aspiration. At their best, humans attempt grand and expansive endeavors, driven to strive after the loftiest and most impossible goals. At their worst, humans are superficial, impractical dreamers who are blind to the consequences of their misguided actions. However, there can be no denying that the best and the worst of humankind—along with the vast swath of humanity in between—have been instrumental in shaping the history of Kaladesh, and continue to shape the destiny of the plane. Their curiosity, their ambition, their apparently boundless energy, and the scope of their vision are powerful forces that drive invention forward.

Human characters thrive on variety and crave new experiences. It's not uncommon for humans to explore several different fields and disciplines in their lifetimes, sometimes abandoning years of accomplishments in one pursuit for the sake of pursuing something new and exciting. This tendency often produces characters who have just enough knowledge of many different fields to be dangerous in all of them. But at the same time, many humans excel at creating synthesis and finding connections between apparently disparate disciplines, bringing a cross-pollination to the process of invention that drives innovation across every field.
