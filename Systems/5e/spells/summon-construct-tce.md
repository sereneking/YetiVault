# Summon Construct
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, an ornate stone and metal lockbox worth at least 400 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth the spirit of a construct. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Construct Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles a golem or a modron (your choice) made of the chosen material, which determines certain traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its move to avoid danger.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Artificer](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Clockwork Soul)](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer-clockwork-soul-tce.md)
