# Psychic Fragment
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 15*

## Salvage

The bones of a mortal transformed into a scream thief remain imbued with its undead aura. A skilled magic item crafter using 200 gp of magical regents, and spending at least 5 days of effort, can create a [wand of silence](/Systems/5e/items/wand-of-silence-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) if they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

A spellcaster can capture a psychic fragment's essence before it dissipates after death. The spellcaster requires a container worth at least 100 gp. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can capture a portion of the defeated psychic fragment. The container can store up to 10 hit die worth of undead essence for 8 hours before they dissipate.

As an action, a container holding this spiritual essence can be thrown up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the broken container must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed saving throw results in `1d4` necrotic damage per hit die of essence stored, while a success deals half as much damage.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The scream thief is immune to necrotic and poison. The incorporeal nature of psychic fragments makes them resistant to nonmagical weapons.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The touch of a scream thief drains life that magic cannot heal; only time and rest can.  

A scream thief remains trapped in its place of death, often accompanied by spirit fragments of the creatures it has killed.
