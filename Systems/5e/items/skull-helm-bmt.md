# Skull Helm
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  


While wearing this skull-shaped helm, you have resistance to cold, poison, and necrotic damage.

Additionally, while wearing the helm, you can cast [Spirit of Death](/Systems/5e/spells/spirit-of-death-bmt.md) from it without requiring material components. Once you use the helm to cast the spell, the helm can't cast this spell again until the next dawn.
