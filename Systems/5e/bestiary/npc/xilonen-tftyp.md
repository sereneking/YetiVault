## Traits

***False Appearance.*** While Xilonen remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal cave formation, such as a stalagmite.

***Grasping Tendrils.*** Xilonen can have up to six tendrils at a time. Each tendril can be attacked (AC 20; 10 hit points; immunity to poison and psychic damage). Destroying a tendril deals no damage to Xilonen, which can extrude a replacement tendril on its next turn. A tendril can also be broken if a creature takes an action and succeeds on a DC 15 Strength check against it.

***Spider Climb.*** Xilonen can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Xilonen makes four attacks with its tendrils, uses Reel, and makes one attack with its bite.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`4d8 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Tendril.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 50 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and Xilonen can't use the same tendril on another target.

***Reel.*** Xilonen pulls each creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it up to 25 feet straight toward it.
