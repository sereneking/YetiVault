# Demon Lord Qorgeth

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Qorgeth takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Qorgeth can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Collapse Passage.** A section of ceiling in the lair collapses, raining debris onto a point Qorgeth can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (`4d8`) bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the debris. A creature, including the restrained creature, can use an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 21 Strength check.  
- **Warp Reality.** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, Qorgeth twists space through the tunnels of its lair. A creature that isn't a demon that tries to move must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or move half its speed in a random direction before getting its bearings; it can then finish moving as it wants.  
- **Worm Infestation.** Thick tangles of demonic worms erupt from the floor, wall, or ceiling near up to three creatures Qorgeth can see within 60 feet of it. Qorgeth commands the tangles to make one melee attack roll (+11 to hit) against each target before disappearing. On a hit, the target takes 14 (`4d6`) piercing damage.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Qorgeth's lair is warped by the demon lord's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Rapid Rot.** Dead bodies within 1 mile of the lair decay quickly. Any corpse is reduced to bones in 24 hours. Magic that prevents decay staves off this decomposition normally. Anointing the body with holy water prevents decomposition for 1 day but no longer.  
- **Spoiled Supplies.** Within 1 mile of the lair, food rots and spontaneously erupts with maggots. One day's worth of food carried by creatures spoils every 24 hours the creature remains in the area. Creatures can't forage for food in this area.  
- **Wormhome.** Tunnels within 5 miles of the lair attract all manner of worms and vermin, including purple worms. These creatures are ravenous and violent.  

If Qorgeth dies, conditions in the area surrounding the lair return to normal over the course of `1d10` days.
