# Bottled Comet
*Wondrous Item, rare*  


This spherical glass orb contains an ignited delerium shard hovering gently within. Electrical currents of yellow, green, and purple energy streak from the crystal and cascade along the glass, rendering it warm to the touch.

As an action you can throw the orb up to 30 feet. It shatters on impact, releasing a 20-foot-radius burst of contaminated energy. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or take (`8d6`) necrotic damage, and take one level of contamination. In addition, an arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim) occurs, centred on the point of impact.
