# Diplomat
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 2*  

You master the arts of diplomacy, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- If you spend 1 minute talking to someone who can understand what you say, you can make a Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check contested by the creature's Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If you or your companions are fighting the creature, your check automatically fails. If your check succeeds, the target is [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you as long as it remains within 60 feet of you and for 1 minute thereafter.
