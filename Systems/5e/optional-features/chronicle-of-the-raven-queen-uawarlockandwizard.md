# Chronicle of the Raven Queen
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Tome, "The Raven Queen" Patron

You can place a corpse's hand or similar appendage on your Book of Shadows and ask one question aloud. After 1 minute, the answer appears written in blood in your book. The answer is provided by the dead creature's spirit to the best of its knowledge and is translated into a language of your choice. You must use this ability within 1 minute of a creature's death, and a given creature can only be asked one question in this manner.
