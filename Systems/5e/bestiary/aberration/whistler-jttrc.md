# Whistler
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 221*  

Whistlers are inscrutable stalkers hailing from airy, screeching reaches of the Far Realm. They are difficult to see as they're not tethered to one point in space, blurring in a state of perpetual physical uncertainty. A dead whistler appears as a gray, featureless, humanlike biped with long limbs and thin fingers. Those stalked by a whistler can't shut out its soundless, seven-note tune, an otherworldly melody that invades and scourges the mind. Few creatures that encounter a whistler escape; those that do are forever haunted by the stalker's frightful tune.

***Otherworldly Melody (Recharge 5-6).*** The whistler telepathically whistles an otherworldly melody into the minds of up to two creatures it can see within range of its telepathy. Each target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (`6d10`) psychic damage and become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the whistler for 1 minute. A [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
