# Sapphire Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Sapphire Anniversary Dice Set_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The dragon targets a creature within 120 feet of it that can hear and understand it. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the following round. A creature [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to itself.  
- The dragon touches a section of stone up to 10 feet in any dimension. The dragon can form the stone into any shape that suits its purpose.  
- A wall of stone springs into existence on a solid surface within 120 feet of the dragon. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 1 foot thick. When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed to either side of the wall the creature wants. Each 5-foot section of wall has AC 17, 20 hit points, vulnerability to thunder damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The wall vanishes when the dragon uses this lair action again or when the dragon dies.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Sapphire Anniversary Dice Set_

The region surrounding a legendary sapphire dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- [Giant spiders](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) are attracted to the area within 6 miles of the lair and settle there in large numbers.  
- Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and sapphire gemstone veins, particularly underground.  
- Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair becomes a conduit for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no components, targeting any natural stone formation in that region.
