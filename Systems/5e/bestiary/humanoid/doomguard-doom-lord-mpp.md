# Doomguard Doom Lord
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 54, Sigil and the Outlands*  

Doom lords are the highest-ranking members of the Doomguard, embodying the multiverse's inevitable collapse into dust. Doom lords' mere presence snuffs the life from weaker foes, and the stoutest walls crumble before them.

## Traits

***Aura of Doom.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the doom lord must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the doom lord doesn't have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition, it can suppress or resume this aura at the start of its turn (no action required).

***Siege Monster.*** The doom lord deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The doom lord makes two Entropic Greatsword or Entropic Javelin attacks.

***Entropic Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.

***Entropic Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage. A creature killed by this attack has its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, reduced to ash.
