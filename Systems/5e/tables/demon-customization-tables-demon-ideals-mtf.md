**Demon Ideals**

`dice: [](demon-customization-tables-demon-ideals-mtf.md#^demon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Self-Preservation. It's everything and everyone for themselves in this cruel world. |
| 2 | Might. The world is divided into the strong who rule and the weak who obey or die. |
| 3 | Cunning. Always have a backup plan ready, especially if it involves betraying someone. |
| 4 | Strength. Strength is the one coin accepted in all realms and by all folk. |
| 5 | Ambition. We reach the station in the cosmos that we deserve due to our drive and talents. |
| 6 | Cruelty. Strength without regular demonstrations of its potential is an empty weapon. |
