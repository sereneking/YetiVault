| dice: d4 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | The smell of apple pie fills the air, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you until the start of your next turn.  |
| 2 | Bouquets of flowers appear all around, and each creature in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of your next turn as the flowers spray water in their faces. |
| 3 | Each creature in the cube must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or begin giggling until the start of your next turn. A giggling creature is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and uses all its movement to move in a random direction. |
| 4 | Drops of molasses appear and hover in the cube, turning it into difficult terrain until the start of your next turn. |
