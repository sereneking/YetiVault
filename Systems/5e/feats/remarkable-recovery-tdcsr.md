# Remarkable Recovery
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 190*  

Your body has the ability to recover quickly from terrible injuries, and is unusually receptive to healing magic. You gain the following benefits:

- When you are successfully stabilized while dying, you regain hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).  
- Whenever you regain hit points as a result of a spell, potion, or class feature (but not this feat), you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1).
