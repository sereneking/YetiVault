# Hoard Scarab
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 205*  

Hoard scarabs are beetle-like creatures that, through some feat of natural adaptation or alchemical ingenuity, blend in perfectly among piles of gold coins. They feed on tiny mites that infest a dragon's scales and lair, and their painful bite can be a strong deterrent to would-be treasure thieves.

Hoard scarabs also produce a glittering metallic dust from their wings that coats intruders who get too close to them. The magic of this dust allows the lair's draconic owner to sense intruders' location as they move about the lair.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the scarab is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the scarab move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the scarab is animate.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it has disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Scale Dust (1/Day).*** The scarab releases magical glittering dust from its wings. Each creature within 5 feet of the scarab must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be outlined in blue light for 10 minutes. While outlined in this way, a creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from being [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible). In addition, every Dragon within 1 mile of the creature becomes aware of it and can unerringly track the creature. Casting [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md) on the creature ends the effect on it.
