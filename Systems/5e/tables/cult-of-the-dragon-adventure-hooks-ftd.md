| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A group of cultists has stolen a dragon egg, with the dual goal of hatching a minion for themselves and gaining leverage over the dragon who was caring for the egg. But the dragon wants the egg back. |
| 2 | A group of cultists is trying to access a magic portal linking the Material Plane to Tiamat's domain, hoping to break the seal that has kept the portal closed for centuries. |
| 3 | A dragon whose echo on another world has become a dracolich suffers from a wasting affliction (see ""Undeath"" above). Members of the Cult of the Dragon are trying to persuade the afflicted dragon to become a dracolich as well. |
| 4 | A dragon and a dracolich, representing the opposing factions of the Cult of the Dragon, war against each other. Their battle is devastating the region between their lairs and endangers countless innocents. |
| 5 | A group of cultists searches for all the [Orbs of Dragonkind](/Systems/5e/items/orb-of-dragonkind.md), planning to use them to bend dragons to their will. |
| 6 | A fringe group of cultists decides to focus on the "shattered thrones" part of the ancient prophecy and attempts to assassinate rulers and destroy their seats of power. |
