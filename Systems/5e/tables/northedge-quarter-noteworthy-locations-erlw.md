**Northedge Quarter: Noteworthy Locations**

| Location | Description | District |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Gates of Passage | Built from Aereni densewood, this spire serves both as the embassy of Aerenal and a temple of the Undying Court. Aereni citizens who die in Sharn are interred in the temple crypts until their remains can be transported to Aerenal. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| Nightshade | An apothecary dealing in exotic herbs and salves, Nightshade is also a tavern specializing in lightly poisoned beverages. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Oaks | A legendary restaurant that serves Aereni and Brelish cuisine. The quality is unmatched, as are the aristocratic prices. Head chef Maza Thadian has maintained the Oaks for over three hundred years, but after her recent appointment as city councilor for Upper Northedge she is often occupied with other matters. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Silver Bough | This establishment deals in arms crafted in the Aereni tradition. This merchandise includes magic items, but woodshaper Tanar Mendyrian takes time to produce his wonders, and only a limited selection is available at any given time. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Winding Root | A marketplace and gallery that showcases the work of elven artisans, including sculptures, textiles, and fine clothing. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| The Veil of Flesh | This studio deals in Aereni body art and alteration, such as tattoos and cosmetic transmutation. | Shae Lias, Upper Northedge |
| Coldflame Keep | A garrison temple of the Silver Flame, this place once housed a hundred templars dedicated to protecting Sharn from supernatural threats. It has largely been abandoned; only a dozen devoted templars and adepts remain in residence. | High Hope, Middle Northedge |
| Daca's Watch | A dwarf named Daca has been sitting on a pillar in Northedge for over a century, offering advice and encouragement. Though she doesn't claim to be a priest, many believe that Daca is blessed and guided by Boldrei. | High Hope, Middle Northedge |
| The Bear's Rest | A modest inn maintained by a beasthide shifter named Leara, who usually gives a discount to traveling shifters. The decor features various exotic hides. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| Fathen's Shrine | This marker in North Market commemorates a miracle that exposed a network of wererats in Sharn, along with the priest of the Silver Flame who died while fighting them. Pilgrims devoted to the Silver Flame often visit the shrine. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| The Horse and Hearth | Though not as colorful as the Bear's Rest, this large inn is maintained by House Ghallanda and offers rooms of modest and comfortable quality. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
| The Rat's Nest | A modest tavern catering to the shifters of Lower Northedge, the Rat's Nest is a haven for gossip and serves food and drink in the Eldeen style. | North Market, Lower Northedge |
