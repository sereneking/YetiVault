# Repulsion Shield
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer Revisited p. 14*  

**Prerequisite**: 8th-level

A creature gains a +1 bonus to Armor Class while wielding this shield. While holding it, the wielder can use a reaction immediately after being hit by a melee attack to push the attacker up to 15 feet away. Once used, this reaction can't be used again until the wielder finishes a short or long rest.
