|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | You stumbled into a giant castle in the sky when you were younger, but no one believed your story. You aim to prove them wrong. |
| 2 | A loved one died mysteriously at sea. You swore the culprit was a sea leviathan everyone else dismissed as a myth, and you seek vindication and revenge. |
| 3 | Stories say you're descended from a legendary giant-killer, and you strive to uphold that legacy. |
| 4 | A city's legends claim the neighboring landscape is the work of some ancient giant sculptor or rampaging titanic beastâ€”or is itself a sleeping giant. You seek to discover the truth of the land's origin. |
| 5 | A relative once returned home claiming to have found a strange island inhabited by ancient, larger-than-life creatures. Because of this, your family became the town laughingstock, and you seek to redeem your family's reputation. |
| 6 | Your sibling says giants and other enormous creatures are stories for children. You hope to slay such a creature and bring back proof of their existence out of spite. |
