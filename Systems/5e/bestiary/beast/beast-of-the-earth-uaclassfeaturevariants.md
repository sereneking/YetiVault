## Traits

***Charge.*** If the beast moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a maul attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra `1d6` slashing damage. The DC equals your spell save DC. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Primal Rebirth.*** If the beast has died within the last hour, you can use your action to touch it and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher. The beast returns to life after 1 minute with all its hit points restored.

***Ready Companion.*** As a bonus action, you can command the beast to make its maul attack or to Hide.

## Actions

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* `1d6 + 2` slashing damage.
