| 1 | "Oh, dear! Did you hear all that commotion yesterday evening near the opera house? It appears that a couple of dignitaries went missing during the performance." |
| 2 | "I hear that Nolson has purses and handbags in his inventory that bear some sort of magic. They'll get snapped up quickly, I'll wager." |
| 3 | "A most dreadful moaning was coming from the plaza today. My friend said she saw a wailing spirit floating over the park. I wish they'd stay in the bank." |
| 4 | "Such a commotion at the Wayfinder Club last night. I heard the fight, but a friend told me there were blades drawn, and the perpetrator escaped!" |
| 5 | "Can you believe the gall of some people? I saw a couple of dirty ruffians in my neighborhood last night, and they were defacing the walls of the courthouse!" |
| 6 | "I still can't believe that crazy old Orzhov syndic just handing out zinos near the plaza, muttering 'The end is near.' She'll invite nothing but undesirables sniffing for free coin." |
