**Bedlam Adventures**

`dice: [](bedlam-adventures-sato.md#^bedlam-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The winds puppeteer the contents of an armory in the Bleakheights. A [goblin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/goblin.md) shopkeep pays the characters to defend their shop's wind chimes from rampaging suits of [animated armor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md). |
| 2 | Each night, a [darkweaver](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/darkweaver-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") snatches a resident of Midtown and drags them into the "Wailing Hollows". Gatekeeper Cirrus calls for the creature's capture or extermination. |
| 3 | Orbys Bumblewing asks the characters to test a dubious new flying machine. During their flight, Nimbus Knife [bandits](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/bandit.md) attempt to steal it. |
| 4 | A wave of murder sweeps through Midtown, caused by a malevolent breeze (use the [ghost](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) stat block) that possesses the townsfolk. |
