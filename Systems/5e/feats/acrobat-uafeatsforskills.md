# Acrobat
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 1*  

You become more nimble, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- As a bonus action, you can make a DC 15 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. If you succeed, difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement until the end of the current turn.
