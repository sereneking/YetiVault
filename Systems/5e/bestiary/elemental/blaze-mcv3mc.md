# Blaze
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: Minecraft Creatures p. 3, Lightning Keep*  

Blazes are elemental beings that congregate at Nether fortresses. They float a short distance above the ground, and each one is orbited by three sets of glowing rods. When a blaze is destroyed, it sometimes leaves one of these rods behind. Blaze rods are a source of great energy that, when carefully crushed into powder, can be used to brew potions and craft other magic items.

A blaze attacks by launching three fireballs from its fiery core. This fire ignites creatures and flammable objects. If necessary, a blaze levitates into the air to better see and more easily target its enemies.

## Traits

***Blaze Rod.*** When the blaze drops to 0 hit points, it disappears in a cloud of smoke and has a 50 percent chance of leaving behind a glowing rod worth 100 gp. The rod sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. As an action, a creature can try to snap the rod, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength check. The snapped rod releases its fiery energy in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 6 (`1d12`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Heat Aura.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the blaze takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage.

***Illumination.*** The blaze sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***Water Susceptibility.*** The blaze takes 1 cold damage for every 5 feet it moves in water, for every gallon of water splashed on it, or whenever it starts its turn in the rain.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The blaze makes three Fiery Doom attacks.

***Fiery Doom.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit; reach 5 ft. or ranged 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) fire damage, and the target catches fire if it's a creature or a flammable object. Until a creature takes an action to extinguish the fire, the burning target takes 3 (`1d6`) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
