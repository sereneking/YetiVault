|----------|--------|
| 1 | Athreos tires of his responsibilities but refuses to abandon them. Secretly, he has allowed the same spirit to be reborn again and again, allowing it to see all of life and death so it might one day take his place. When this apprentice disappears, Athreos refuses to ferry any more souls until his student is returned. |
| 2 | The wealth Athreos collects in payment for his work has gone missing, stolen from his sanctuary at the end of the Tartyx River. The River Guide needs the treasure returned swiftly, not out of greed, but as it is payment for something beyond the gods. |
| 3 | The Rivers That Ring the World are drying up. As the tides recede, great ruins are revealed, rising from the river bottom. Athreos sends agents to the headwaters of the Tartyx River, seeking the cause of the problem before whatever the river had kept drowned emerges. |
| 4 | War between Heliod and Erebos is inevitable. Rather than letting it explode unpredictably, Athreos puts a plan into Motion to mitigate the damage. Ultimately, all it takes to end the war is Heliod's death or Erebos joining the Returned. |
