# Knight of Eldraine
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

The realm of Eldraine once consisted of five knightly courts: Ardenvale, Embereth, Garenbrig, Locthwain, and Vantress. In ancient times, the courts were established around five relics of tremendous magical power and unknown origin. Each relic is a magical embodiment of one of the five virtues the knights of the realm hold as standards of excellence.

The recent invasion of nightmarish creatures called Phyrexians devastated the courts, with much of the surviving populace fleeing into the wilds. A young prince, Will Kenrith, does his best to reunite the shattered realm, but a return to its former glory seems far off.

Even in the shattered remnants of the realm, knighthood is among the highest honors one can receive. Knights of the realm, who are all addressed with the honorific "Syr," are revered as champions, heroes, and paragons of virtue. They have many responsibilities, from protecting townsfolk to embarking on adventures in the wilds. Knights are often equipped with fine armor and weapons, and they ride noble steeds of various species—including griffons in Ardenvale, giant owls in Vantress, and giant ravens (use the giant vulture stat block) in Locthwain. Some knights also wield powerful magic drawn from the relics of their respective courts.

In the wake of the Phyrexian invasion, whole orders of knights have journeyed deep into the wilds, searching for a magical remedy to restore the kingdom to its former glory, or seeking to help travelers and remote communities beset by troubles.

Achieving knighthood in one of the courts requires a quest that proves one's excellence in that court's virtue. In some courts, the final step to becoming a knight involves being judged by that court's relic. Each court believes the virtue associated with its own relic is paramount, though not in lieu of the others. A knight of Embereth admires courage above all else but still looks down on the disloyal or ignorant, even though loyalty and knowledge are virtues championed by other courts.

Knights of Eldraine channel their devotion to the virtues of the realm into magical power that infuses their attacks. Most knights deal extra radiant damage with these attacks, but some knights might deal damage of a different type, such as fire (for knights of Embereth) or necrotic (for knights of Locthwain).

> [!note] The Verdant Order
> 
> In the wake of the Phyrexian invasion, knights from all five courts of Eldraine have joined to form a new organization, the Verdant Order. These knights renounced their oaths in favor of a new one, swearing to protect the last part of their world untouched by war: the wildest parts of Eldraine. To that end, they patrol the forests along the Boundary Lands, turning back loggers and hunters—by force if necessary.
> 
> Though they've renounced their former oaths, the knights of the Verdant Order retain their focus on the five virtues of the courts, so their Knightly Virtue trait remains unchanged.
