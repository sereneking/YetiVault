| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Revelers joined a group of [satyrs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/satyr.md) in their festivities. As the satyrs' celebration has continued for over a year, the revelers seek the characters' help in extricating themselves without offending their hosts. |
| 2 | A kindly [green hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/green-hag.md) influenced by "Elysium" invites passersby to join her for tea in her cottage made of sweets. She makes some of the best cookies in the Outlands. |
| 3 | A pack of [blink dogs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/blink-dog.md) tracks a band of [maelephants](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (presented "later" in this book) to prevent them from spoiling lands influenced by the Upper Planes. |
| 4 | A gnarled [dryad](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/dryad.md) influenced by "Carceri" seeks to entrap creatures within the root-snarled, prison-like cavern beneath her grove. |
