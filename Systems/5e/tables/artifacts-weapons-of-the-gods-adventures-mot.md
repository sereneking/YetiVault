| dice: d6 | Plot |
|----------|------|
| 1 | Steal a god's weapon to lay low one of that god's servantsâ€”a creature that can only be harmed by its creator's wrath. |
| 2 | Recover a god's weapon that has been stolen by another god's champion in an attempt to frame the weapon's owner for cruel acts. |
| 3 | Wrest back a god's weapon from a divine champion who needed it but refuses to return it. |
| 4 | Destroy a god's weapon and channel the energy released to create a new magic item or work a miracle. |
| 5 | Reforge a god's weapon after an incredible feat caused it to shatter. |
| 6 | A god's weapon has gained sentience (see ""Sentient Magic Items"" in chapter 7 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). Determine whether to use it, return it to its creator, or help it grow into its own being. |
