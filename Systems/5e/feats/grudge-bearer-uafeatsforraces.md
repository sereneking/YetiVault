**Prerequisite**: [Dwarf](/Systems/5e/races/dwarf.md)

You have a deep hatred for a particular kind of creature. Choose your foes, a type of creature to bear the burden of your wrath: aberrations, beasts, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, giants, monstrosities, oozes, plants, or undead. Alternatively, you can choose two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs). You gain the following benefits:

- During the first round of any combat against your chosen foes, your attack rolls against any of them have advantage.  
- When any of your chosen foes makes an opportunity attack against you, it makes the attack roll with disadvantage.  
- Whenever you make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History), [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature), or [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)) check to recall information about your chosen foes, you add double your proficiency bonus to the check, even if you're not normally proficient.
