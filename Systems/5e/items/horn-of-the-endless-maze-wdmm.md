# Horn of the Endless Maze
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Abyss appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits look like minotaurs, and use the [berserker](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) statistics. They return to Abyss after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The horn summons `3d4 + 3` [berserkers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md). To use the horn, you must be proficient with all simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [berserkers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/berserker.md) attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
