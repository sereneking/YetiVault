# Giant Fire Beetle
*Source: Monster Manual p. 325, Tales from the Yawning Portal, Waterdeep: Dragon Heist, Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage, Plane Shift: Ixalan, Quests from the Infinite Staircase. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules.*  

A giant fire beetle is a nocturnal creature that takes its name from a pair of glowing glands that give off light. Miners and adventurers prize these creatures, for a giant fire beetle's glands continue to shed light for `1d6` days after the beetle dies. Giant fire beetles are most commonly found underground and in dark forests.
