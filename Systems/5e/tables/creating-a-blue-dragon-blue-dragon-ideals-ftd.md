**Blue Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-blue-dragon-blue-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^blue-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Order. Life is best when everyone is part of a hierarchy and rules are clear and consistent. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Humor. Lesser beings exist to be my playthings, and I excel at finding ways to toy with them. (Evil) |
| 3 | Taste. I value my possessions for more than just their beauty and consider gauche displays of wealth a sign of inferiority. (Any) |
| 4 | Family. Blood ties are irrevocable, and even if one doesn't particularly like one's family members, they come before anyone else. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Display. One should never take risks or waste resources by using power if one can achieve the same results merely by the threat of power. (Any) |
| 6 | Loyalty. I don't form bonds with those outside my kindred often. But when I do, I am an unshakable and powerful ally. (Good) |
