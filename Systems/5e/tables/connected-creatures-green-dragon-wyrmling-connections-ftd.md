| 2 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) was raised by a cluster of [pseudodragons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md), whom the wyrmling now protects. |
| 3 | Hobgoblin raiders have captured several [green dragon wyrmlings](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md), hoping to use them as the vanguards of their war parties. |
| 4 | A [green dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/green-dragon-wyrmling.md) exacerbates the chaotic tendencies of a group of [satyrs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/satyr.md), driving them to greater acts of mischief with the promise of rich rewards. |
