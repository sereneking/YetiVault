| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | This zone suppresses all aggressive thought. Any creature that wants to make an attack or cast a damaging spell must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn't make the attack or cast the spell, but loses its action. |
| 2 | Those with great will and fortitude who ascend a mountain peak in this area can try to bend the weather for miles around to their will, as if they had cast the [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) spell. |
| 3 | In this sun-dappled field, children—as well as free-spirited, childlike folk—find themselves able to fly for 1 hour. |
| 4 | A village is built into the side of a cliff face here. Windmills protruding from the cliff collect energy from the power of the wind, which is used to operate elevators throughout the community. |
