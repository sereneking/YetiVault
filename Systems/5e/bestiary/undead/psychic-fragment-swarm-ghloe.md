# Psychic Fragment Swarm
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 15*

## Salvage

The bones of a mortal transformed into a scream thief remain imbued with its undead aura. A skilled magic item crafter using 200 gp of magical regents, and spending at least 5 days of effort, can create a [wand of silence](/Systems/5e/items/wand-of-silence-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) if they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

A spellcaster can capture a psychic fragment's essence before it dissipates after death. The spellcaster requires a container worth at least 100 gp. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can capture a portion of the defeated psychic fragment. The container can store up to 10 hit die worth of undead essence for 8 hours before they dissipate.

As an action, a container holding this spiritual essence can be thrown up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the broken container must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed saving throw results in `1d4` necrotic damage per hit die of essence stored, while a success deals half as much damage.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The scream thief is immune to necrotic and poison. The incorporeal nature of psychic fragments makes them resistant to nonmagical weapons.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The touch of a scream thief drains life that magic cannot heal; only time and rest can.  

A scream thief remains trapped in its place of death, often accompanied by spirit fragments of the creatures it has killed.

## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The swarm can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Maddening Voices.*** The swarm constantly emits a babble of words and phrases spoken in life by its many undead spirits. Each creature that starts its turn within 20 ft. of the swarm must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on a saving throw becomes immune to maddening voices for 24 hours.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Withering Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage, or 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
