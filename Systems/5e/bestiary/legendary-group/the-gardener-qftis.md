# The Gardener

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Gardener can take one of the following lair actions; they can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Plant Walk.** The Gardener moves up to their speed into the space of a Medium or larger plant within the lair, then teleports to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of any other Medium or larger plant within the lair.  
- **Vine Wall.** A wall of grasping vines appears on the ground within 120 feet of the Gardener. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the grappled condition (escape DC 15). A creature must make this saving throw when it starts its turn inside the wall or when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn. The wall's area is difficult terrain for a creature that isn't grappled. The wall sinks back into the ground, freeing all creatures grappled by it, when the Gardener uses this lair action again or when the Gardener dies.  

## Regional effects


The Eternal Garden has the following features:

- **Boundary.** At the border of the domain is a lightly obscuring mist, tinged with a sweet blossom scent and the colors of sunset. No matter how far a creature travels into the mist, the creature finds itself back where it entered the border, returning to the garden.  
- **Eternal Summer.** The climate in the garden is a perpetual, lovely summer, but weather conditions reflect the emotional tone of creatures in the garden. In times of danger, thunderstorms shake the sky. During times of melancholy or mourning, chill rain patters throughout the domain.  
- **Gardener's Vigil.** The Gardener senses when anything dies in the garden. If a creature dies in the garden, roll a `d6`. On a 1, the Gardener appears on initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties) to investigate.  
- **Lighting.** The sky above the garden is a perpetual twilight range of orange, red, pink, and yellow hues with no visible sun, moon, or stars. During daylight hours, it emits bright light, but at night, it never reaches full darkness, becoming dim light instead.  
- **Memory Loss.** Unless otherwise stated, a creature that leaves the domain must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw; Fey creatures and creatures with the Fey Ancestry trait automatically succeed on the saving throw. On a failed save, the creature remembers nothing of its time in the garden or the Palace of Spires. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact, but they're hazy and dreamlike. A Remove Curse or Greater Restoration spell restores the creature's memories.  
- **Time.** Time passes slower in the Eternal Garden relative to other planes. For each day spent in the garden, one year passes on the Material Plane.
