# Sacrament of the Falling Fire
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*9th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a delerium fragment worth 100 gp for each participating creature, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell may only be cast in an area covered by the Deep Haze.

You perform a holy ceremony involving up to 12 faithful and willing humanoid creatures that ends when each participating creature drives a delerium shard into their chest. Those creatures become sanctified (see the Followers of the Falling Fire dossier in chapter 3 of Dungeons of Drakkenheim).

When you finish casting this spell, a hostile [shadow](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/shadow.md) appears and attacks each participant, as a manifestation of that character's inner darkness. The GM may determine that a character who carries great anger, fear, or hate in their heart causes a [wraith](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/wraith.md) to manifest instead.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
