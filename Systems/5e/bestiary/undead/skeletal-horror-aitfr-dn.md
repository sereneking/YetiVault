# Skeletal Horror
*Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night p. 13*  

This horrid mass of bones clambers along on a dozen hands and feet without maintaining any consistent shape. One moment it moves like a centipede, the next it rears back to claw like a bear. The only consistent feature is a weird absence: no matter how many skulls make up its mass, this strange horror always seems to be headless.

The skeletal horrors in Kyrilla's lair are made from the bones of yuan-ti supplicants and cultists who came to learn her powers or, later, to steal them. She spared none of these intruders' lives, and in death their remains do her bidding.
