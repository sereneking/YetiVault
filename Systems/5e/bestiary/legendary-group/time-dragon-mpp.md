# Time Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the ancient or adult dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Temporal Fling..** The dragon attempts to fling a creature it can see within 60 feet of itself forward through time. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or take 26 (`4d12`) psychic damage and move 1 round forward in time. A target moved forward in time vanishes for the duration. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in an unoccupied space nearest to that space if it's occupied.  
- **Temporal Lag..** The dragon slows time for each creature within 60 feet of itself. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, the affected creature can move or take an action on its turn, not both. The creature also can't take a reaction or a bonus action.  
- **Timeline Divergence..** The dragon chooses a space it can fit into within its lair. The dragon exists simultaneously in its space and the chosen space until initiative count 20 on the next round. Whenever it moves or takes an action, the dragon chooses which version is moving or acting. If an effect or attack can target both the dragon's spaces at the same time, the dragon is affected only once.  

## Regional effects


The region surrounding an ancient or adult time dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Time Dilations.** Time fluctuates within 3 miles of the lair. Short rests taken within this area take 10 minutes or 2 hours (your choice).  
- **Timelessness.** Beasts, Humanoids, and Plants within 3 miles of the lair age only 1 year for every 10 years that pass.  

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
