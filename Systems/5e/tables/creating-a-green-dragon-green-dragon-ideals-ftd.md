**Green Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-green-dragon-green-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^green-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Isolation. Territories can be properly established only when all parties respect the borders of their neighbors. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Control. All lesser beings should bare their throats to their betters. (Evil) |
| 3 | Respect. Fear is amusing, but reverence is delicious. (Any) |
| 4 | Intrigue. The world is so much more entertaining when no one trusts anyone. (Evil) |
| 5 | Imagination. Nothing is more gauche than repeating the same activities day after day. (Any) |
| 6 | Tolerance. The impermanence of intelligent life is bittersweet and should be honored as such. (Good) |
