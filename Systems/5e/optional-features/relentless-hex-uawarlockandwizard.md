# Relentless Hex
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 5th-level, "The Hexblade" Patron

Your Hexblade's Curse creates a temporary bond between you and your target. As a bonus action, you can magically teleport to a space you can see within 5 feet of the target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse. To do so, you must be able to see the target and must be within 30 feet of it.
