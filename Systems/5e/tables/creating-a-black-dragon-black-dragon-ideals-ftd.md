`dice: [](creating-a-black-dragon-black-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^black-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Envy. If the achievements of others cannot be eclipsed, they can always be torn down. (Evil) |
| 2 | Acquisitiveness. Possessing what others covet is immensely satisfying. (Any) |
| 3 | Cunning. Destroying your foes without exposing yourself to danger is an art. (Evil) |
| 4 | Adaptability. It is not the most powerful, but the most flexible who survive. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | Patience. There's no need to rush a poorly constructed plan when time is on your side. (Any) |
| 6 | Serenity. Observing a culture sliding into oblivion along the trek of time puts life in perspective. (Any) |
