# Glasya

## Regional effects
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

The region containing Glasya's lair is corrupted by her presence, which creates the following effect:

- **Hag's Gaze.** Every hour that a good creature travels within 1 mile of the lair, a blast of fire erupts from one of the eye sockets of the lair. If the target fails a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, they take 42 (`12d6`) fire damage, half on a successful save. If the creature was flying and fails the saving throw, it falls. Only one such creature is targeted each hour.  

If Glasya dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Glasya can take one lair action to cause the following effect or one from the archdevil lair action list (page 214); she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Change Appearance.** Glasya polymorphs into a Small or Medium Humanoid she has seen, or back into her true form. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her true form if she dies.  

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The [Summoned Underlings](/Systems/5e/tables/archdevil-lair-action-list-summoned-underlings-coa.md) table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
