# Poisoner
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 2*  

You can prepare and deliver deadly poisons, gaining the following benefits:

- When you make a damage roll, you ignore resistance to poison damage.  
- You can coat a weapon in poison as a bonus action, instead of an action.  
- You gain proficiency with the [poisoner's kit](/Systems/5e/items/poisoners-kit.md) if you don't already have it. With one hour of work using a [poisoner's kit](/Systems/5e/items/poisoners-kit.md) and expending 50 gp worth of materials, you can create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute, or until you hit with the weapon. When a weapon coated in this poison deals damage to a creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take `2d8` poison damage and become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the end of your next turn.
