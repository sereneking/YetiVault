# Morphoi
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 277*  

*This blue-skinned humanoid wields a trident and has an unusual face with vertical eyes but no mouth or nose.*

## Shapeshifter Plants

Morphoi are shape-shifting plant creatures indigenous to many islands. In their natural forms, the morphoi are androgynous beings between 5 and 6 feet tall. Their elliptical heads have pairs of eyes on both front and back. When harmed, they bleed a dark red sap. As plants, the morphoi don't need to eat. Instead, they gather nutrients from the sun and air. When posing as humanoids, they consume small amounts of food to aid their disguise, but since they have no internal digestive system, the food is just stored inside their bodies until they can spit it out.

## Ship Travel

Morphoi live in island communities and in nearby waters, traveling by ship. They harbor a powerful animosity toward intelligent animal life, and their disguised agents are behind many otherwise inexplicable acts of sabotage and murder in coastal areas. Unlike doppelgangers, morphoi can't mimic specific individuals or read thoughts. Instead, they create intriguing backgrounds to go along with their disguises.

## Four Eyes Always

No matter what form they shift into, morphoi always have four eyes, never two. They can relocate their eyes to anywhere on their bodies, however, and they try to keep the second pair of eyes on the back of the head or neck (concealed by long hair or a tall collar), or the backs of the hands (under gloves but useful to peer around corners).

> [!note] Morphoi in Midgard
> 
> Morphoi in Midgard serve and venerate Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. They willingly give their lives to protect her, her handmaidens, and her followers. Because of Mnemosyne's influence over time as well as memory, morphoi in Midgard have been blessed by their goddess with immunity to magic that manipulates time, including spells that age the morphoi or spells such as haste or slow.
