| dice: d20 | Insult |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Did your mother have any children who lived? |
| 2 | Who dressed you, a grimlock? |
| 3 | You smell like a hell hound's hindquarters. |
| 4 | You're as helpful as a halfling. |
| 5 | Let me guess. You're a self-taught wizard? |
| 6 | Your personality has all the warmth of a winter wolf. |
| 7 | You're the loveliest hag in the coven. |
| 8 | You're not the sharpest piercer in the cave. |
| 9 | Aren't you a little short for a giant? |
| 10 | Truly, your intellect is as deep as a [Tenser's floating disk](/Systems/5e/spells/tensers-floating-disk.md). |
| 11 | Did you wake up in a troglodyte den this morning, or is that how you normally smell? |
| 12 | You must have been sick the day they taught fighting at warrior school. |
| 13 | Gruumsh must have closed his eye when he created you. |
| 14 | I can see you, but where's the dragon that pooped you out? |
| 15 | You've got all the good sense of a mind flayer's last meal. |
| 16 | You don't know a beholder from a gas spore. |
| 17 | I suspected you'd fallen out of the idiot tree, but I didn't know you were dragged through Stupid Forest afterward. |
| 18 | There's nothing about your looks that a full-face helmet wouldn't improve. |
| 19 | You're about as useful as an orc horde at a tea party. |
| 20 | I've seen better-looking faces on a gibbering mouther. |
