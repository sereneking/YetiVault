# Theologian
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 4*  

Your extensive study of religion rewards you with the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You learn the [thaumaturgy](/Systems/5e/spells/thaumaturgy.md) and [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) spells. You can cast [detect evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-evil-and-good.md) once without expending a spell slot, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.
