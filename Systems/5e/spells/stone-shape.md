# Stone Shape
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.

**Classes**: [Artificer](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md), [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/Systems/5e/classes/druid-circle-of-the-land.md), [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md), [Warlock (The Genie)](/Systems/5e/classes/warlock-the-genie-tce.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
