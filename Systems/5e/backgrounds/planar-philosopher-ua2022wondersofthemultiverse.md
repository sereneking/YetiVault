# Planar Philosopher
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 3*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana), [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)  
- **Languages.** Two of your choice  
- **Equipment.** A set of [common clothes](/Systems/5e/items/common-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 10 gp comprised of coins from different worlds and planes  

You subscribe to a distinct philosophy that seeks to understand the nature of the planes or some hidden truth of the multiverse. You draw strength from your conviction and, perhaps, a network of like-minded believers. In your travels, you seek to deepen the depths of your understanding and spread your philosophy.

## Feature: Conviction

You gain the [Scion of the Outer Planes](/Systems/5e/feats/scion-of-the-outer-planes-ua2022wondersofthemultiverse.md) feat. In addition, members of organization provide you free, modest lodging and food at any of their holding or the homes of other faction members.

## Building a Planar Philosopher Character

Some groups of planar philosophers might have preferences for or against certain types of characters, but by and large any character that upholds and furthers the beliefs of the group is welcome within its ranks.

### Suggested Characteristics

Adventurers who dedicate themselves to a particular philosophy toward the multiverse are welcomed among the faction that embraces those beliefs. The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character, and which factions would welcome adventurers with those traits.

| 2 | Experience is everything, live in the moment. |
| 3 | When things crumble, I find meaning in the ashes. |
| 4 | Life thrives through order; I won't tolerate disruptions. |

| 6 | I know what's right, and no one will stand in my way. |

### Planar Philosopher Trinkets

When you make your character, you can roll once on the Planar Philosopher Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.
