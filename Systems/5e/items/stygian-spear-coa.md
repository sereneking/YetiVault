# Stygian Spear
*Generic Variant, very rare (requires attunement)*  


You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you throw it, it deals one extra die of damage on a hit. After you throw it and it hits or misses, it flies back to your hand immediately.

## Curse

You're unwilling to part with this weapon while attuned to it. In addition, you have disadvantage on attack rolls made with weapons other than this one.

Whenever you roll a 1 on an attack roll using this weapon, your target changes to your closest ally.

If there are multiple allies, randomly determine which is the target. Make a new attack roll with advantage against your ally. If the attack hits, in addition to the standard damage you deal an extra `2d6` poison damage. Only the [Remove Curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell allows you to end attunement to this item.

## Corrupting

This item corrupts. See the "Infernal Item Corruption" section.
