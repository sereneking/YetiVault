`dice: [](connected-creatures-topaz-dragon-wyrmling-connections-ftd.md#^topaz-dragon-wyrmling-connections)`

| dice: d6 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Moved by pity, a [giant eagle](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-eagle.md) continues bringing food to an abandoned [topaz dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md), despite the wyrmling's attempts to eat the eagle. |
| 2 | A [pseudodragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon.md) who is fanatical about the kinship of all dragonkind is trying to win a [topaz dragon wyrmling's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) friendship. |
| 3 | A [topaz dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) has developed a taste for crab meat and persistently hunts a [giant crab](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-crab.md) that always manages to evade the wyrmling. (The crab might have been the recipient of a druid's [awaken](/Systems/5e/spells/awaken.md) spell.) |
| 4 | A mated pair of [griffons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/griffon.md) found a topaz dragon egg, and they care for it as if it were their own. |
| 5 | A [sea hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fey/sea-hag.md) is on the hunt for a [topaz dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md), to be used as a component in a fell ritual. |
| 6 | A pirate crew keeps a curmudgeonly [topaz dragon wyrmling](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/topaz-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md) as a beloved mascot. |
