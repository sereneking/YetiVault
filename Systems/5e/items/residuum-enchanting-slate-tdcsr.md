# Residuum Enchanting Slate
*Tools, unknown (magic)*  

- **Cost**: 20,000 gp

[Residuum](/Systems/5e/items/residuum-tdcsr.md) can also be heated and blown into glass, forming a shimmering, greenish surface. Residuum slates or orbs can be used in stationary enchanting tables. Archmages willing to pay exorbitant rates—easily 20,000 gp or more—may acquire an [enchanting slate](/Systems/5e/items/residuum-enchanting-slate-tdcsr.md) that can be used to expedite the creation of all magic items. Using such a table allows anyone crafting a magic item to do so in one-quarter of the usual time.
