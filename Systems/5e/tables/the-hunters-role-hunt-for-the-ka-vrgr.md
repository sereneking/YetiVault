| dice: d6 | Hunt |
|----------|------|
| 1 | The characters come to the attention of High Priest Rehkotep, who demands they aid her in finding the pharaoh's lost treasure or face punishment. |
| 2 | Revolutionaries displeased with the priests and the pharaoh search for Ankhtepot's lost treasure in hopes of gaining leverage over the ruler. |
| 3 | The sphinxes of Har'Akir know that Ankhtepot is close to finding his lost ka. They hope to find it first and place it outside the Darklord's reach. |
| 4 | A Child of Ankhtepot, either a loyal servant like Nephyr or a traitor like Senmet, tasks the characters with finding the lost ka to fulfill their own ends. |
| 5 | Murals or hieroglyphs within a tomb the characters discover lead to other ruins, each bearing a clue to finding the pharaoh's missing treasure. |
| 6 | After the characters die, Pharaoh Ankhtepot resurrects them (perhaps as reborn; see "chapter 1"). Their continued existence is contingent on searching for and finding his ka. |
