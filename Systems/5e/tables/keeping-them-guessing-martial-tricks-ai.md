**Martial Tricks**

`dice: [](keeping-them-guessing-martial-tricks-ai.md#^martial-tricks)`

| dice: d6 | Trick |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | You are an expert at pretending you've been injured to the point where you can't possibly go on. By goading foes to finish you off, you keep your allies safe as you reveal how much fight you still have in you. |
| 2 | You always keep a small pouch of salt or sand at your belt. If you can blind an opponent, even momentarily, you can usually end a fight quickly. |
| 3 | You fight with your off hand at the start of a battle, so that your opponent sets their defenses and attacks to one side. Then you quickly switch hands at the most opportune moment, making your foe wonder what other tricks you might play. |
| 4 | Swearing, name-calling, political satireâ€”you do it all. You make use of a range of down-and-dirty fighting epithets that would make an ogre barbarian blush. |
| 5 | You constantly converse with your opponents during the battle, doing whatever you can to distract them or get into their heads. It's surprising how many combatants enter a fight not knowing whether their boots have come untied. |
| 6 | You have a belt pouch specially made to release ball bearings or caltrops in the thick of the fight, forcing your enemies to avoid those hazards while fending off your blows. |
