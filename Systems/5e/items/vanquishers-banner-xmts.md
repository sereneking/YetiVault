# Vanquisher's Banner
*Wondrous Item, unknown (magic)*  


This battle-worn but unbroken standard bears the insignia of one of the forces of the Legion of Dusk. A creature that holds the vanquisher's banner can use a bonus action to grant an ally advantage on the ally's next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check.
