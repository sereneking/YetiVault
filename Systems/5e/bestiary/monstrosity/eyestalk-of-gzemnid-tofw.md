# Eyestalk of Gzemnid
*Source: Turn of Fortune's Wheel p. 88*  

Gzemnid is a beholder god of deception, gases, and obscurement.

The realm of the beholder deity Gzemnid lies beneath the Outlands. Most entrances into these mysterious, gas-filled caverns are found near chaotically aligned gate-towns—like Bedlam, Sylvania, or Xaos—but Gzemnid's Realm is elusive, even by the mutable standards of the Outlands.

## Traits

***Tunneler.*** The eyestalk can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The eyestalk attacks with its bite and uses Eradication Gaze.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d8 + 9`) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the eyestalk. A swallowed creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the eyestalk, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the eyestalk's turns.

If the eyestalk takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the eyestalk must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the eyestalk. If the eyestalk dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Eradication Gaze (Recharge 5-6).*** The eyestalk creates an area of magical devastation in a 150-foot cone. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (`10d10`) necrotic damage. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine violet dust.
