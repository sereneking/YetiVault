# Vargouille Reflection
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 52, Sigil and the Outlands, Turn of Fortune's Wheel*  

Vargouilles are flying Fiends that resemble disembodied Humanoid heads with wings. While most vargouilles roam the planes to curse Humanoids and create more vargouilles, a variant known as the vargouille reflection resides in Undersigil. When a vargouille reflection spots a Humanoid target, it takes on that creature's visage, terrifying that creature by appearing as its own disembodied head.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The vargouille has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage.

***Abyssal Curse.*** The vargouille targets one Humanoid within 5 feet of itself that has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or become cursed. The cursed target's Charisma decreases by 1 after each hour, as its head takes on fiendish aspects, and its Charisma can't increase. The curse doesn't advance while the target is in sunlight or the area of a [daylight](/Systems/5e/spells/daylight.md) spell. When the cursed target's Charisma becomes 2, the target dies, and its head tears from its body and becomes a new vargouille reflection. Casting remove curse, greater restoration, or a similar spell on the target before the transformation is complete ends the curse and restores the target's Charisma.

***Horrific Reflection (Recharge 5-6).*** The vargouille's head mimics that of a Humanoid the vargouille can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage and have the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition for 1 hour or until the vargouille loses [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) (as if concentrating on a spell). If the target's saving throw is successful or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Horrific Reflection of all vargouille reflections for 1 hour.
