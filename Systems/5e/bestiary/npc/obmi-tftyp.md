## Traits

***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, Obmi has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit Obmi scores against a [surprised](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#surprised) creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If Obmi is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, Obmi instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** Obmi deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of Obmi that isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and Obmi doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

***Dwarven Resilience.*** Obmi
