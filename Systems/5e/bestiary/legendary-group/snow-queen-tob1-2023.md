# Snow Queen

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Snow Queen takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Snow Queen can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Induce Snow Blindness.** The snow and ice of the lair shimmer and gleam, catching the light and flashing it into the eyes of the Snow Queen's foes. Each hostile creature within 30 feet of the Snow Queen has disadvantage on attack rolls against her until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- **Isolated Blizzard.** A blast of wintry weather and heavy snow falls in a 30-foot radius centered on a point on the ground that the Snow Queen can see within 120 feet of her. The area becomes difficult terrain, and each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the snow. A creature, including the restrained creature, can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. The snow melts away when the Queen uses this lair action again or when the Queen dies.  
- **Snow Wall.** A wall of dense snow erupts on a solid surface within 120 feet of the Snow Queen. The wall is up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick, and it blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature in its area must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) cold damage and be pushed 5 feet out of the wall's space, appearing on whichever side of the wall it wants. A creature can move through the wall, though the wall is filled with freezing snow. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. A creature that starts its turn in the wall or enters the wall's space for the first time on a turn must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`4d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each 10-foot section of the wall has AC 5, 15 hp, vulnerability to fire damage, resistance to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The wall melts when the Queen uses this lair action again or when she dies.  

## Regional effects


The region containing the Snow Queen's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Concealing Flurries.** Light snowfall or swirling powder blown by the wind lightly obscures the area within 5 miles of the lair.  
- **Permafrost.** Within 10 miles of the lair, snow and ice resist melting, doing so only after prolonged contact with fire or other major source of heat.  
- **Snow-Covered Land.** Deep snow and frequent snowfall make the area within 3 miles of the lair difficult terrain for Medium and smaller creatures.  

If the Snow Queen dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
