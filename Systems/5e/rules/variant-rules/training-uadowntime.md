# Training
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 13* 

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

## Resources

Training in a language or tool takes at least 10 workweeks, but reduce this time by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 100 gp per workweek.

## Complications

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher.
