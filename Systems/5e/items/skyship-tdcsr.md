# Skyship
*Airship, Vehicle (air)*  

- **Cost**: 100,000 gp

Purchasing a [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) costs 100,000 gp, and requires a personal connection with the Alsfarin Union in "Ank'Harel". A [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) travels at a top speed of 10 miles per hour, can carry total cargo of 10 tons, and requires a crew of six to ten humanoids to operate at peak performance. Most [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) have maximum accommodations for up to 30 passengers. Most [skyships](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) only travel between existing skyports (see ""Emon Skyport","), and charge a fee of 2 gp per mile for a passenger ticket. Chartering a [skyship](/Systems/5e/items/skyship-tdcsr.md) to a destination off the standard sky routes costs 15 gp per mile, if the captain is available and willing to undertake the journey. Shipping cargo costs 1 gp per mile per 100 pounds of cargo along normal sky routes, and twice that to other destinations.
