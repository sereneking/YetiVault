# Lord of the Hunt
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 174*  

*Astride a midnight horse sits a shirtless elven huntsman. His broad chest is thickly muscled and sports tattooed knot work. Great stag antlers crest the huntsman's head, curving above his rich brown hair. The pale green glow that shines from his eyes obscures the elf 's strong features, and a massive spear twined with glowing green vines drives forward in his clenched fist*.

The baying of shadow hounds, the thundering of hoof beats, and a brassy horn note; the Wild Hunt is coming, and pity its quarry. The Lord of the Hunt is an enigma among the fey nobles. His true identity beyond title and position as master of the Wild Hunt is unknown, but he has some connection to the Black Prince of the shadow fey—while also answering to elvish druids and consorting with powerful hags and dryads.

## The Wild Hunt

The Lord's court is the Wild Hunt itself, a group of huntsmen, revelers, intelligent hounds, and poor souls they sweep up in their frenzy. His home, if he has any permanent dwelling, is as mysterious as his true identity. He and his Hunt constantly move between the Plane of Shadow and the most ancient forests.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## The Lord of the Hunt's Lair

If the Lord of the Hunt has any permanent lair, it is unknown to all but his closest confidants. While the Wild Hunt is a thing of beautiful and deadly grace on the move, the Lord's encampment becomes his lair when the Hunt settles for any length of time. Tents and pavilions house the Lord and his Hunt, and great, roaring fires roast the day's kills. The hours pass with revelry, feasting, physical contests, and strong drink.

## Traits

***Huntsman's Weapons.*** The Lord of the Hunt's weapon attacks are magical. When he hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) poison damage (included in the attack).

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Lord of the Hunt fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Sure Seat.*** While mounted and not [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated), the Lord of the Hunt can't be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), dismounted, or moved against his will.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Lord of the Hunt makes three Spear or Longbow attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) piercing damage, or 9 (`1d8 + 5`) piercing damage if used in two hands, plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage. If the Lord of the Hunt throws the spear, the spear teleports up to 120 feet to the Lord of the Hunt's hand at the start of his next turn. If he has no hand free, the spear teleports to the ground at his feet.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) poison damage.

***Hunter's Quarry.*** The Lord of the Hunt magically calls `3d6` elk or boars, `1d4` giant boars or giant elk, or 1 elephant. The called Beasts arrive in `1d4` rounds, acting as allies of the Lord and obeying its spoken commands. The Beasts remain for 1 hour, until the Lord dies, or until the Lord dismisses them as a bonus action. The Lord can have any number of Beasts under its control at one time provided the combined total CR of the Beasts is no higher than 8.

## Bonus Actions

***Fey Mount.*** The Lord of the Hunt can summon or dismiss a magical Fey mount, mounting or dismounting it as part of this bonus action without spending movement. The mount uses the statistics of a warhorse, except it has 40 hp, is a Fey, has the same damage and condition resistances and immunities as the Lord of the Hunt, and uses the Lord's saving throw bonuses in place of its own. If the mount is slain, it disappears, leaving behind no physical form, and the Lord of the Hunt must wait 1 hour before summoning the mount again.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The Lord of the Hunt increases his AC by 6 against one attack that would hit him. To do so, he must see the attacker and must be wielding a melee weapon.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** The Lord of the Hunt makes one Spear or Longbow attack.

***Tenacious Stride.*** The Lord of the Hunt moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. If he is mounted, he can force the mount to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks instead.

***Call to the Hunt (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Lord of the Hunt blows his hunting horn and chooses one creature he can see within 60 feet. If the creature can hear the horn, it must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the Lord of the Hunt for 8 hours. The [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target obeys the Lord's verbal commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to the Lord's Call to the Hunt for the next 24 hours. The Lord can have only one target [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) at a time. If he charms another, the effect on the previous target ends.
