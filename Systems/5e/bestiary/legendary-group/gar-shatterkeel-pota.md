# Gar Shatterkeel

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Gar is in the water node while [Olhydra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/olhydra-pota.md) isn't, he can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar uses a lair action to use his Multiattack or cast one of his spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. He can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, but he can continue to concentrate on a spell he previously cast using a lair action. He can take no other lair actions while concentrating on a spell cast as a lair action. His favorite use of this capability is casting [inflict wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/inflict-wounds.md) or [call lightning](/Systems/5e/spells/call-lightning.md).

If Gar casts [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md) using this lair action, he regains the maximum number of hit points from the spell (28).
