# Kyrilla, Accursed Gorgon

## Lair actions
_Source: Adventures in the Forgotten Realms: Deepest Night_

When fighting inside her lair, Kyrilla can invoke the ambient magic there to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- Kyrilla casts [moonbeam](/Systems/5e/spells/moonbeam.md) (no components required). While maintaining [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on this effect, she can't take other lair actions.  
- Kyrilla casts [cloud of daggers](/Systems/5e/spells/cloud-of-daggers.md) (no components required), except the daggers are flying snakes and the spell deals piercing damage. While maintaining [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) on this effect, she can't take other lair actions.  
- Pools of liquid within 60 feet of Kyrilla surge and froth, splashing and soaking any creature on the ground within 5 feet of such pools. Creatures that succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw avoid getting liquid in their eyes and mouths. Kyrilla can't use this lair action again until she has used a different one.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Kyrilla's lair is warped by her accursed nature and the meteoric stone around her, which together create the following effects:

- Water sources within the lair are supernaturally fouled and poisonous. Creatures that drink these waters must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. Afflicted creatures can make a new saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on a success.  
- Plants within 1 mile of the lair suffer from a calcifying mold that dries and hardens leaves, killing many otherwise hearty thistles and heather.  
- Fog lightly obscures the land within 3 miles of the lair.
