`dice: [](apocalyptic-calamities-bmt.md#^apocalyptic-calamities)`

| dice: d12 | Calamity |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | The [tarrasque](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) awakens. (A [kraken](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken.md), an [empyrean](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/empyrean.md), or another titan might also serve as an agent of apocalyptic wrath.) |
| 2 | A deadly plague that's resistant to curative magic sweeps the land. |
| 3 | A prolonged drought leads to terrible famine. |
| 4 | A volcano (or chain of volcanoes) erupts. |
| 5 | A large asteroid crashes into the world. |
| 6 | A vast sinkhole opens, swallowing a city into the Underdark or one of the Lower Planes, or releasing hordes of Fiends. |
| 7 | The gods are stripped of their power and are forced to occupy mortal forms. |
| 8 | The world is drawn into another plane of existence. |
| 9 | The gods war among themselves or against incredibly powerful alien beings. |
| 10 | Magic goes awry, creating random zones of wild magic (where casting any spell of 1st level or higher causes a roll on the [Wild Magic Surge table](/Systems/5e/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) in the "Player's Handbook") and dead magic (like an [Antimagic Field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md) spell on a larger scale). |
| 11 | The corpse of a slain god falls to the earth. |
| 12 | Every Dragon is consumed with unthinking rage and unleashes devastation on those living nearby. |
