# Empathic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 2*  

You possess keen insight into how other people think and feel. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You can use your action to try to get uncanny insight about one humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. Make a Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check contested by the target's Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) check. If your check succeeds, you have advantage on attack rolls and ability checks against the target until the end of your next turn.
