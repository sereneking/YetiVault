# Radiant Weapon
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer Revisited p. 13*  

**Prerequisite**: 8th-level

This magic weapon grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, the wielder can take a bonus action to cause it to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The wielder can extinguish the light as a bonus action.

As a reaction immediately after being hit by a melee attack, the wielder can cause the attacker to be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of the attacker's next turn, unless the attacker succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. Once used, this reaction can't be used again until the wielder finishes a short or long rest.
