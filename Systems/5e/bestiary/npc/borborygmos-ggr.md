# Borborygmos
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 238*  

For decades, the enormous cyclops Borborygmos has commanded the respect and obedience of the Gruul Clans by defeating all who challenged him. He embodies the raging fire that the Gruul believe burns in their bellies, and his wrath toward the civilization of Ravnica knows no bounds.

## Mightiest of the Mighty

Borborygmos leads the Burning Tree clan, which is the largest and most diverse of the Gruul Clans. He is almost always accompanied by other members of his clan-not because he needs their protection, but because they might need his. His companions include creatures ranging from burly giants to cowering goblins.

The Gruul follow strength, and Borborygmos holds his position only because he has proved stronger than any challenger.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Borborygmos fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Poor Depth Perception.*** Borborygmos has disadvantage on any attack roll against a target more than 30 feet away.

***Siege Monster.*** Borborygmos deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Borborygmos can use his Frightful Presence. He also makes two attacks: one with his maul and one with his stomp.

***Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`6d6 + 7`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`2d10 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (`4d10 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Borborygmos's choice that is within 60 feet of him and can see or hear him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of him for 1 minute. The [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

***Attack.*** Borborygmos makes a weapon attack.

***Bellow (Costs 2 Actions).*** Borborygmos yells menacingly at one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of him for 1 minute. If the creature is already [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), it becomes [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) instead. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Borborygmos's Bellow for the next 24 hours.

***Wide Berth (Costs 3 Actions).*** Borborygmos moves up to half his speed and can move through the space of any creature smaller than Huge. The first time Borborygmos enters a creature's space during this move, the creature must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. If the saving throw succeeds, the creature is pushed 5 feet away from Borborygmos. If the saving throw fails, that creature is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), and Borborygmos can make a stomp attack against it.
