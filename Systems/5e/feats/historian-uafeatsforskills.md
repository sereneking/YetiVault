# Historian
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 2*  

Your study of history rewards you with the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- When you take the [Help](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Help) action to aid another creature's ability check, you can make a DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)) check. On a success, that creature's check gains a bonus equal to your proficiency bonus, as you share pertinent advice and historical examples. To receive this bonus, the creature must be able to understand what you're saying.
