# Fey Teleportation
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf (High)](/Systems/5e/races/elf-high.md)

Drawing on your fey ancestry, you have learned how to teleport. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn the [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md) spell and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.
