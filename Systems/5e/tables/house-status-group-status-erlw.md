**Group Status**

`dice: [](house-status-group-status-erlw.md#^group-status)`

| dice: d4 | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Favored**. You have access to the leadership of the house, owing to your record of faithful service. |
| 2 | **Reliable**. You are reliable contributors to the house, and can count on it for help in difficult situations. |
| 3 | **Oddballs**. You don't quite fit in, and tend to draw strange assignments or those that other operatives pass up. |
| 4 | **Outcast**. You have made some mistakes in the recent past, and your status in the house is tenuous at best. |
