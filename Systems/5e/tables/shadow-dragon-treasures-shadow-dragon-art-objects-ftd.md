| dice: d10 | Object |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | An ornate scepter marred by soot and grime |
| 2 | A priceless painting badly in need of restoration |
| 3 | A lump of melted precious metal that was once a splendid necklace and holds gemstones inside it |
| 4 | A series of fine charcoal drawings depicting the royal lineage of a prominent drow house |
| 5 | A seemingly plain gray tapestry; close inspection reveals a tableau in shades of dove, ash, and slate |
| 6 | A pair of stonework gargoyles rendered in a grotesquely baroque and terrifying style |
| 7 | A pile of loose sheet music representing the lost dirges of a famous shadar-kai bard |
| 8 | An exquisitely crafted mirror that drains all color from the reflections of those who look into it |
| 9 | A ventriloquist's dummy made to resemble the vampire Strahd von Zarovich |
| 10 | A peculiar dragonchess set entirely crafted from onyx, making it extremely difficult to tell one side's pieces from the other |
