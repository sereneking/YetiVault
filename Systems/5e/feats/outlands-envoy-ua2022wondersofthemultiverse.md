# Outlands Envoy
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 7*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You have spent significant time in Sigil or elsewhere in the Outlands, the crossroads of the multiverse. Being steeped in converging planar energies grants you these benefits:

- **Crossroads Emissary.** You learn the [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md) and [tongues](/Systems/5e/spells/tongues.md) spells. You can cast each spell once using this feat without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast that spell in this way again. When you cast tongues using this feat, you require no material components. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell's spellcasting ability is the one chosen when you gained the Scion of the Outer Planes feat.
