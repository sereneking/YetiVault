# The Bloody End (Awakened)
*Melee Weapon, artifact (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 1d8 P
- **Properties**: Martial, [Vestige](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

## Sentience

The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

## Personality

A tyrannical [pit fiend](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

## Dormant

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Infernal.  
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.  
- While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [dominate person](/Systems/5e/spells/dominate-person.md), or [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md). Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.  
- While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks.  

> [!note] Betrayer Artifact Properties
> 
> The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and one [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) property and an additional [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [major beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.

## Awakened

When the morningstar reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.  
- The saving throw DC for spells cast from the morningstar increases to 15.  
- When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an attack using The Bloody End, you can cause the following effect: each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the end of your next turn. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.  
- When a creature hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal `1d6` psychic damage to the attacker.
