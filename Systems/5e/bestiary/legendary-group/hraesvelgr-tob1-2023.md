# Hraesvelgr

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Hraesvelgr takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Hraesvelgr can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Pillar of Wind.** One creature within 60 feet that Hraesvelgr can see must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be swept up in a pillar of wind. The creature is restrained and suspended 15 feet off the ground. A creature can take an action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a DC 19 Strength check. If the restrained creature has a way to pull itself out of the air, it can free itself in the same way. If the restrained creature has a flying speed, it can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, this effect lasts until Hraesvelgr uses this lair action again or until he dies.  
- **Powerful Exhale.** Hraesvelgr unleashes a blast of wind in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.  
- **Terrifying Utterance.** Hraesvelgr lets out a thunderous bellow. Each creature within 30 feet of him and that can hear him must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Hraesvelgr's lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Active Weather.** Strong windstorms are common within 6 miles of the lair.  
- **Roosting Rocs.** Within 3 miles of the lair, giant avian Beasts are more populous and fiercely defend the area against intruders.  
- **Stench of Decay.** The wind within 10 miles of the lair bears a pungent carrion stench.  

If Hraesvelgr dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
