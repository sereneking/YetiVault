*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

You have absorbed primeval magic that allows you, despite your relatively small stature, to embody the might of titanic creatures. This grants you the following benefits:

- **Little but Mighty.** You gain proficiency in either the [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics) or [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) skill.  
- **Powerful Build.** You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the amount you can push, drag, or lift.  
- **Stalwart.** You have advantage on saving throws against being moved or knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
