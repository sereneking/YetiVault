**Origin of Dragon Eggs**

`dice: [](reproduction-origin-of-dragon-eggs-ftd.md#^origin-of-dragon-eggs)`

| dice: d10 | Origin |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Spontaneous Reincarnation**. When an adult or older dragon dies, one or more eggs form in the dragon's decomposing body. These eggs might grow like fungus as the body rots away, they could appear among the ashes after the body is consumed by fire, or they might need to be mined out from a corpse that has turned to solid stone or metal. |
| 2 | **Seedlings of the First World**. At the heart of the world (underground, or in a remote area of pristine wilderness) stands a tree on which dragon eggs grow like fruit. Once in a lifetime, each dragon feels an overwhelming urge to seek out this tree. After finding it, the dragon must persuade its guardian to relinquish one or more eggs. |
| 3 | **Consuming Treasure**. By eating a significant portion of their own hoards, dragons cause themselves to lay clutches of eggs. |
| 4 | **Magical Crafting**. Mirroring the creative acts of Bahamut and Tiamat, dragons craft their eggs through painstaking labor, then breathe the gift of life into them. |
| 5 | **Draconic Transformation**. Enlightened non-dragons (most often Humanoids) are transformed into dragon eggs when they die, when they experience profound enlightenment, or when they undergo a ritual that might involve bathing in dragon blood or being devoured by a dragon. Humanoids and dragons alike understand the transformation to be a transition into a higher state of existence. |
| 6 | **Divine Origin**. Only Bahamut and Tiamat can create dragon eggs—each egg is the result of divine intervention. |
| 7 | **Spontaneous Formation**. Dragon eggs arise naturally in certain regions, often in underground veins of metal ore or gems for metallic and gem dragons, respectively, or in extreme environments (volcanoes, arctic wastes, deadly swamps, and so forth) for chromatic dragons. The eggs might hatch on their own, or they might have to be unearthed first by another creature, whether that's an adult or older dragon or a hapless miner. |
| 8 | **Parthenogenesis**. An adult or older dragon can lay a clutch of eggs whenever the dragon feels ready to rear a clutch of wyrmlings—or to impose that responsibility on others. |
| 9 | **Dragon Conclave**. Five adult or older dragons of different kinds come together to create a clutch of eggs, with each giving up a bit of life energy as part of the process. This clutch of eggs hatches five dragons of different kinds, depending on the dragons making up the conclave. |
| 10 | **Rejuvenation**. An ancient dragon voluntarily enters a deep trance and eventually dies, leaving behind a single egg. |
