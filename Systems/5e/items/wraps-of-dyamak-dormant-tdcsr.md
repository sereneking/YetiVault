# Wraps of Dyamak (Dormant)
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a monk)*  

- **Properties**: [Vestige](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

Created and wielded by the ancient warrior-monk Dyamak, these thick strips of enchanted cloth are stained to appear dark crimson with blood of unknown origin. The current resting place of the wraps is unknown.

## Dormant

When the Wraps of Dyamak are in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with your unarmed strike while wearing them.

In addition, when you finish a short or long rest, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your total number of ki points.
