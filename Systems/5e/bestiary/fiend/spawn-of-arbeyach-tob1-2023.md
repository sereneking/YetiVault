# Spawn of Arbeyach
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 91*  

*This insectile humanoid's mouth stretches over dripping mandibles that are poorly concealed behind an ill-fitting mask of flesh. Its eyes have compound irises, and barbed stingers sprout between the fingers at the ends of its long, segmented limbs.*

Spawn of Arbeyach are extensions of the will of Hell's Prince of Swarms, Arbeyach, and often serve him in the mortal world as the arch-devil carries out their master's wishes. To this end, they often inhabit hives of tosculi that worship Arbeyach.

## Skin and Carapace

Spawn of Arbeyach are roughly humanoid, with many insectoid qualities, including a hardened carapace and oddly-jointed limbs. Their faces, arms, and legs are covered with a largely decorative skin which stretches and tears to reveal insectile traits.

## Hive Dwellers

They dwell in hive structures comprised of natural growth and rigid architecture. The hives are built in isolated, easily-defensible locales, and visitors often must climb or fly to reach them.

## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the spawn's darkvision.

***Hive Bond.*** While the spawn is within 60 feet of at least one member of its hive, it has advantage on initiative rolls and on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks. The spawn can't be surprised if at least one other member is aware of the danger and within 300 feet of it.

***Magic Resistance.*** The spawn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Speak with Insects.*** The spawn can communicate with insects as if they shared a language.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spawn of Arbeyach makes one Bite attack and one Stinger attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) poison damage.

***Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) piercing damage plus 13 (`3d8`) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Children of Arbeyach (1/Day).*** The spawn of Arbeyach magically calls `1d4` swarms of insects. The called creatures arrive in `1d4` rounds, acting as allies of the spawn and obeying its spoken commands. The insects remain for 1 hour, until the spawn dies, or until the spawn dismisses them as a bonus action.
