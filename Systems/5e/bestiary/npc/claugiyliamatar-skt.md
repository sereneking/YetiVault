## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The dragon can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** Claugiyliamatar casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 19):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md), [speak with animals](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-animals.md)

**1/day each**: [blight](/Systems/5e/spells/blight.md), [legend lore](/Systems/5e/spells/legend-lore.md) (cast as 1 action), [locate creature](/Systems/5e/spells/locate-creature.md), [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md), [protection from energy](/Systems/5e/spells/protection-from-energy.md), [true seeing](/Systems/5e/spells/true-seeing.md)

**2/day each**: [animal messenger](/Systems/5e/spells/animal-messenger.md), [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [entangle](/Systems/5e/spells/entangle.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`2d10 + 8`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) poison damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`4d6 + 8`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 77 (`22d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** The dragon makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dragon makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
