# Smaragdine Golem
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 219*  

*This large statue of emerald-green crystal has a humanoid body with the head of an ibis. Tiny symbols and runes are etched into it, and portions of it are inlaid with bits of gold.*

## Occult Initiates

Smaragdine golems are crafted by disciples of occult esoterica to guard their secret meeting halls, sacred texts, and the arcane books of power.

## Emerald Body

Though they seem to be made entirely of emeralds (and some are used in their construction), a smaragdine golem's body is closer to enchanted glass than to gemstones, a sad truth that has disappointed many plunderers.

## A Maker's Privilege

Though smaragdine golems are sometimes given to powerful mages, scholars, theurgists, and hierophants as a token of esteem, they are always subject first to the magic and orders of their creators.

## Traits

***Construct Nature.*** The golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Enchanted Weapons.*** The golem's weapon attacks are magical. When the golem hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `5d8` force damage (included in the attack).

***Immutable Form.*** The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Vessel.*** When the smaragdine golem counters or ends a spell with Absorb Spell, it holds the spell's magical energy within its body and becomes Charged for 1 minute. While Charged, the golem sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The smaragdine golem makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Release Spell.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d8 + 7`) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (`5d8`) force damage.

***Release Spell (Recharge Special).*** The smaragdine golem releases an absorbed spell's energy in a green burst centered on a point the golem can see within 60 feet of it. Each creature, other than the smaragdine golem, within 5 feet of that point per level of the absorbed spell must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (`3d6`) force damage per level of the absorbed spell and is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) until the end of its next turn. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). The golem can use this action only if it is Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait).

## Reactions

***Absorb Spell.*** When a creature the smaragdine golem can see within 30 feet of it casts a spell, the golem can absorb the spell's energy, countering it. This works like the [counterspell](/Systems/5e/spells/counterspell.md) spell, except the golem must always make a spellcasting ability check, no matter the spell's level. Alternatively, when a creature the golem can see within 30 feet of the golem starts its turn while under the effects of a spell, such as bless or heroes' feast, the golem can absorb the spell's magic, ending the effect. In either case, the golem's ability check for this is +10. If it successfully counters or ends the spell, it becomes Charged (see the Magic Vessel trait). The golem can't use Absorb Spell while it is Charged.
