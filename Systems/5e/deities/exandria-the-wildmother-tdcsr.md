The realm of the Wildmother extends to wherever the seas shift and the land grows over. As the keeper of the wilderness, she represents the wild creatures of nature, the rush of the angry rapids, and the heat-heavy stillness of the desert. Hunters, druids, and nomads worship her, seeking her blessing to live in harmony with lands that still bear their wild fangs. Likewise, those seeking safe passage across dangerous waters pray to her to guide them.

The druids of the Wildmother and clerics of her lover, the Lawbearer, work together to preserve the balance of nature and civilization. It is said that the two goddesses grow furious when this balance is upset, and this fury manifests as devastating natural disasters. Clerics of the Matron of Ravens also pay homage to the Wildmother, for the work she begins is the work that their deity must respectfully end.

## Depiction

Immortalized through wooden reliefs and carved idols in hidden, overgrown groves and rural shrines, the Wildmother is shown as a beautiful woman with green or deep brown skin nearly swallowed by a wild, tangled wreath of hair, leaves, and vines that envelop her strong, full-figured form.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Wildmother's clerics are granted powers of Life, Nature, or Tempest.

## Holy Day

The Wildmother's holy day is Wild's Grandeur, and is celebrated on the vernal equinox, usually the twentieth day of the third month. The people of the southern wilds honor the Wildmother by journeying to a place of great natural beauty, like the top of a mountain waterfall or the center of a desert. Wild's Grandeur is rarely celebrated in "Emon", but some folk will plant trees in observance of the holiday.

- Protect the untamed wilderness from exploitation and destruction.  
- Slay abominations and other mockeries of nature.  
- Embrace and respect that which you cannot control in this world. Exist in harmony with it.
