| 1 | One staircase leads to two different places somehow. |
| 2 | Any kettle used in the kitchen screams when it boils. |
| 3 | Every chair has one leg slightly shorter than the others. |
| 4 | Every stairwell has an illusion of one additional step at the top. |
| 5 | There's a nest in the attic. A big nest. Like, really big. |
