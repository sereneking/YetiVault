# Sage's Signet (Songbird)
*Ring, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


This gilded ring bears a beautiful engraving and is imbued with powers of keen wisdom and foresight. While wearing this ring, you can use an action to cast the [Augury](/Systems/5e/spells/augury.md) spell from the ring. Once you use the ring to cast the spell, the ring can't cast the spell again until the next dawn.

While wearing the Sage's Signet, you can cast the [Charm Person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md) and [Hypnotic Pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md) once each from the ring using your Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. Once you cast each spell from the ring, the ring can't cast the spell again until the next dawn.
