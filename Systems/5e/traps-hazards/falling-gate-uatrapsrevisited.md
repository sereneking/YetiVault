# Falling Gate
*Generic Hazard*  

Some folk who build dungeons, such as mad wizards in search of new victims, have no intention of allowing their visitors to make an easy escape. This trap is fiendish because it causes a gate to drop some distance away from the pressure plate. The gate might close off the dungeon entrance, which is hundreds of feet away. Adventurers don't know they are trapped until they decide to head back to town.
