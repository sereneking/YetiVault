# Scion of Surtur

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Surtur is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Abundant Ore.** Veins of precious metals and ore are more common within 6 miles of the scion.  
- **Desertification.** Precipitation is almost nonexistent within 6 miles of the scion, parching the land and withering most plant life.  
- **Empowered Fire Giants.** Fire giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +8 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  

If the scion dies, existing ore remains, but new veins of ore stop forming. The other effects end immediately.
