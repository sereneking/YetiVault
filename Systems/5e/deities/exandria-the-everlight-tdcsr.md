God of compassion and redemption, the Everlight bears a divine message of determination and compassion, even in the darkest of times. She believes that the corrupt can be redeemed, a mindset that led to a betrayal by the Lord of the Hells, who decimated her followers during the "Calamity". Only recently has her faith been rediscovered and her temples returned to prominence. The Everlight's followers are often rural healers and community philosophers, offering voices of reason and empathy in angry and cynical times.

## Depiction

Those who rise to bring the Everlight's words back to the light either unearth her image from ruined temples or create new art to inspire others with her message. She is represented as a beautiful, strong woman with dark skin and light hair, rising betwixt a set of angelic ivory wings.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Everlight's clerics are granted powers of Life, Light, or Peace.

## Holy Day

The Everlight's holy day has long been forgotten, and her followers have yet to decide when her festival should be held, or even what the festivities should be. The debate has gone on for years, and no great miracles have yet been performed to unify the squabbling clerics.

- Lead with mercy, patience, and compassion. Inspire others to unite in fellowship.  
- Aid those who are without guide. Heal those who are without hope.  
- Those who are beyond redemption, who revel in slaughter and remorseless evil, must be dispatched with swift justice.
