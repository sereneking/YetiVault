## Traits

***Roleplaying Information.*** Vaasha is a skilled hunter and tracker who doesn't charge into danger without first assessing the risks. She's not afraid to speak her mind, even to her king. To her, a worthy leader values the truth, no matter how painful it is.

Ideal: "I want this conflict over with so that I can return to the quiet stillness of the ocean depths."

Bond: "I'll protect this beautiful world from the ravages of evil with my dying breath."

Flaw: "I don't care if my words hurt others' feelings."

***Amphibious.*** Vaasha can breathe air and water.

***Spellcasting.*** Vaasha casts one of the following spells, requiring no material spell components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md), [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) (cast as 1 action), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Vaasha makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (`6d6 + 9`) slashing damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 35 (`4d12 + 9`) bludgeoning damage.

***Lightning Strike (Recharge 5-6).*** Vaasha hurls a magical lightning bolt at a point it can see within 500 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (`12d8`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
