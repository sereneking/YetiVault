# Mithral Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Impaling Spikes.** Metallic spikes sprout from the ground beneath one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage and is restrained as it is impaled on the magical spikes. On a success, a creature takes half the damage and isn't restrained. A creature, including the restrained target, can take its action to free the restrained target by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check to break the spikes.  
- **Shimmering Scales.** Light within the lair bends toward the dragon, reflecting brilliantly off its scales. Each creature within 30 feet of the dragon and that can see it must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.  
- **Wave of Peace.** A pulse of calming energy washes over the lair. Each hostile creature the dragon can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become indifferent about creatures of the dragon's choice that it is hostile toward for 1 minute. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the effect ends, the creature can choose to become hostile again.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a legendary mithral dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Calming Air.** Humanoids within 6 miles of the lair experience feelings of peace and are less prone to mood swings. Dragons within 6 miles of the lair experience the opposite effect, becoming plagued by anxiety and irritability.  
- **Peaceful Realm.** When a Dragon or Humanoid within 3 miles of the lair attempts to commit an act of violence against a Dragon or Humanoid and that act of violence isn't in self-defense, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to commit acts of violence, other than self-defense, for 1 minute. The dragon can choose to suppress this effect for any creature.  
- **Shining Mithral.** Objects made from metals other than mithril appear dull and feel heavy while within 1 mile of the dragon's lair.  

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
