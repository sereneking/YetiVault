Master of the skein of fate and the mistress of winter, the Matron of Ravens is the god of death. Her gaze follows and marks the end of each mortal life, watching over the transition between life and death—and ensuring that the natural transition is undefiled. Mourners at funerals across the land invoke her blessing in hopes that she will protect the deceased from the terrible curse of undeath.

Keepers of ancient lore believe the Matron of Ravens was once mortal herself, and thus the only mortal known to have ascended to godhood—before the rise of The Whispered One, at least. Her rise instantly obliterated the previous, now-forgotten god of death, and in its wake, the other gods quickly and fearfully destroyed the secrets to the rites of ascension.

## Depiction

There are very few visual depictions of the Matron of Ravens; many temples simply use the raven as a symbol of her blessing. Rare images, however, portray the Matron herself as a tall, pale woman wrapped in dangling black linens, her onyx-black hair straight and never-ending, her face obscured by a white porcelain mask.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Matron of Ravens's clerics are granted powers of Death, Grave, or Twilight.

## Holy Day

The Matron of Ravens's holy day is the Night of Ascension, which celebrates her apotheosis. The actual date of the goddess's rise to divinity is unclear, but the Night of Ascension is nonetheless celebrated on the thirteenth day of the tenth month. Many people of "Emon" see this cheery celebration of the dead to be unnerving and macabre, but the Matron's followers believe that the honored dead would rather be venerated with cheer than misery. The Matron of Ravens is also considered by some to be the patron of Winter's Crest, a holiday that celebrates freedom from "Errevon the Rimelord" and is observed in Tal'Dorei on the twentieth day of the eleventh month.

- Death is the natural end of life. Grieve the fallen, but do not pity them. Exult in the time that they were granted.  
- The path of Fate is sacrosanct. Those who pridefully cast off destiny must be punished.  
- Undeath is an atrocity. Death is too good a punishment for those who pervert the rightful transition of the soul.
