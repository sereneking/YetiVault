# Sea Twins' Gift
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Archfey" Patron

The Sea Twins rule seas in the Feywild. Their gift allows you to travel through water with ease. You can breathe underwater, and you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

You can also cast [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md) using a warlock spell slot. Once you cast it using this invocation, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
