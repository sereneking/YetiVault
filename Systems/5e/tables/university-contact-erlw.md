**University Contact**

`dice: [](university-contact-erlw.md#^university-contact)`

| dice: d8 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | An overworked department head who doesn't quite know what to make of you but gives you work to keep you busy |
| 2 | A career bureaucrat who insists you file paperwork in multiple offices in order to get anything done |
| 3 | A junior professor who might be more interested in selling plundered artifacts than in actual research |
| 4 | A department secretary who thinks you're a great deal more interesting than any of the regular faculty |
| 5 | An erudite dean who believes you have tremendous potential and urges you on to greater endeavors |
| 6 | An energetic librarian or museum curator who addresses every question, assignment, or acquisition with disproportionate enthusiasm |
| 7 | A tired senior professor whose only joy in academia is seeing what you bring back from your adventures |
| 8 | An eager researcher who wants to come with you on every adventure because second-hand reports are always incomplete and unsatisfying |
