# Crusher
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 1*  

You are practiced in the art of crushing your enemies, granting you the following benefits:

- Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack that deals bludgeoning damage, you can move it 5 feet to an unoccupied space, provided the target is no more than one size larger than you.  
- When you score a critical hit that deals bludgeoning damage to a creature, attack rolls against that creature are made with advantage until the end of your next turn.
