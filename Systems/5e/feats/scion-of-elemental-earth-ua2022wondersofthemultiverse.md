# Scion Of Elemental Earth
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 8*  

You've been exposed to the primordial magic of the Elemental Plane of Earth, granting you the following benefits:

- **Elemental Magic.** You learn the [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md) cantrip, using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (choose when you select this feat).  
- **Earthen Shield.** You can use a bonus action to conjure a bulwark of earth that provides half cover to you or a creature of your choice within 30 feet of yourself. The bulwark remains until the start of your next turn. You can create this bulwark a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
