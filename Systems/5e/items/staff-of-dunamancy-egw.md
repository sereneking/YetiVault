# Staff of Dunamancy
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff of polished gray wood bears numerous runes carved along its length. The staff has 10 charges and regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff turns into dust and is destroyed.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 2 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: [fortune's favor](/Systems/5e/spells/fortunes-favor-egw.md) (2 charges), [pulse wave](/Systems/5e/spells/pulse-wave-egw.md) (3 charges), or [gravity sinkhole](/Systems/5e/spells/gravity-sinkhole-egw.md) (4 charges).

## New Possibility

If you are holding the staff and fail a saving throw against a spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
