# Stone of Ill Luck
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This polished agate appears to be a [stone of good luck](/Systems/5e/items/stone-of-good-luck.md) to anyone who tries to identify it, and it confers that item's property while on your person.

## Curse

This item is cursed. While it is on your person, you take a -2 penalty to ability checks and saving throws. Until the curse is discovered, the DM secretly applies this penalty, assuming you are adding the item's bonus. You are unwilling to part with the stone until the curse is broken with [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) or similar magic.
