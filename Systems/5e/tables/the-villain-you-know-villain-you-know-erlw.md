|----------|---------|
| 1 | A con artist takes advantage of people who fall for their scams, but leaves behind no proof of any crime. |
| 2 | A cowardly politician fleeces the poor of their last few coins without technically doing anything wrong. |
| 3 | A righteous zealot is continually poking into the characters' business, judging their actions and methods while doing even worse things in the shadows. |
| 4 | A powerful figure in a dragonmarked house is using the house's resources for criminal deeds, but there's no trail of evidence leading back to the villain. |
| 5 | A crime lord has the local authorities on the payroll, so no official action will ever be taken to stop their criminal activities. |
| 6 | A villainous mastermind cooperates with local law enforcement to track down and eliminate rival villains, without ever giving the authorities a peek into their own evil deeds. |
