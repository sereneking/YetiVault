# Jijibisha Manivarshi
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 128*  

Jijibisha Manivarshi, a vicious soul from the land's past, lurks in the nearby forest. Long ago she made a deal with wicked otherworldly forces that gave her longevity and fiendish powers, a bargain that ultimately resulted in the ruin of Manivarsha.

Despite her fiendish powers, she looks like an ancient, withered human.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Jijibisha has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Jijibisha's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Jijibisha's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). Jijibisha can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [alter self](/Systems/5e/spells/alter-self.md), [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md), [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md)

**3/day each**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md), [wall of fire](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-fire.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Jijibisha can use its Hypnotic Gaze and makes three melee attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage, or 8 (`1d10 + 3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Hypnotic Gaze.*** Jijibisha's eyes sparkle with opalescent light as it targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. If the target can see Jijibisha, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) until the end of Jijibisha's next turn. The [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned). If the target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to Jijibisha's gaze for the next 24 hours.

***Teleport.*** Jijibisha magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
