# Sailback
*Source: Plane Shift: Ixalan p. 30*  

## Scales, Spikes, and Hammers

Sailbacks are predators that lurk in lakes and rivers to ambush unwary prey. Their statistics are equivalent to those of the [giant crocodile](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-crocodile.md) in the "Monster Manual".

## Dinosaurs

Dinosaurs are the dominant form of animal life in Ixalan—the absolute rulers of the coastal lands held by the Sun Empire, and a force to be reckoned with in the interior jungles. A number of dinosaurs appear in the "Monster Manual", with even more to be found in "Volo's Guide to Monsters", making that a particularly worthwhile resource for an Ixalan campaign. (Many of the dinosaurs in "Volo's Guide" also appear in Tomb of Annihilation.)

## Traits

***Hold Breath.*** The sailback can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sailback makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (`3d10 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the sailback can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target not [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the sailback. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
