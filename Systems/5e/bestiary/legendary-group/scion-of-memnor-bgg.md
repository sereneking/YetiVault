# Scion of Memnor

## Regional effects
_Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants_

The region surrounding a scion of Memnor is altered by the giant's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Compulsory Offering.** The first time a sapient creature comes within 6 miles of the scion, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or feel an overwhelming compulsion to leave an offering worth at least 5 gp stashed in an out-of-the-way place. Cloud giants within 6 miles of the cradle or scion immediately sense the location of this gift. A creature can be affected only once by this compulsion.  
- **Empowered Cloud Giants.** Cloud giants within 1,000 feet of the scion gain a +8 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  
- **Mischievous Whispers.** Whispers can be heard on the wind within 1 mile of the scion. The words are indistinct, but a creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or higher interprets them as instructions for a prank they can play on others.  

If the scion dies, these effects end immediately.
