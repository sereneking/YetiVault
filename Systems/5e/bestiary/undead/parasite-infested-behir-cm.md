# Parasite-infested Behir
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 220*  

When a parasite-infested behir roars or discharges their lightning breath, thousands of gray, parasitic blood worms can be seen writhing inside their mouths. Targeting the behir with magic that removes a disease kills off its blood parasites.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) piercing damage.

***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 5 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage plus 17 (`2d10 + 6`) slashing damage. The target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The behir exhales a line of lightning that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (`12d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Swallow.*** The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (`6d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

Any creature swallowed by a parasite-infested behir must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the behir's turns or be feasted upon by blood parasites, taking 36 (`8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save. This damage is in addition to the damage caused by the behir's digestive acids.

If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
