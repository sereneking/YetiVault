# Shadow Fey
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 158*  

*A gray-skinned elf steps out of the darkness itself. Its pair of onyx horns seems to absorb the light around it. It gives a friendly smile, revealing small fangs*.

To most, the shadow fey are little more than a dancing shadow among the leaves. To savants, they are the creatures that taught the shadowdancers all they know—and kept many secrets to themselves. They were once elves like all others, dwelling in mortal lands beneath the sun. An ancient catastrophe drove them to darkness, and now they are creatures of the shadow. Though they can be found on the Material Plane, they are inextricably tied to the Plane of Shadow, and that is the seat of their power and culture. Their bond with darkness allows the shadow fey to slip through distant spaces, traversing darkness itself from one place to another.

## Shadow Elves

Shadow fey superficially resemble other elves, but they're rarely mistaken for their light-bound cousins. Skin tones among the shadow fey range from alabaster white to ebony black, with shades of gray in between, but they otherwise lack color. A few have a scintillating shimmer to their skin. Many shadow fey grow horns that sweep out from their hair, varying in size from subtle nubs to obvious spikes. Others have shocking sets of teeth.

## Dual Natured

The shadow fey are contradictory beings. They boast some of the best features of elves, tempered by aspects of a fouler nature. They can be deliberate and purposeful, but they're also given to perplexing whimsy. Mortal creatures trying to fathom shadow fey motivations are in for a maddening experience; they are often illogical, capricious, and seemingly thrive on annoying others.

## Split Rulership

The Summer Court and Winter Court each rule the shadow fey in the appropriate season. The turning of these seasons follows no clear calendar or schedule, though it is skewed toward summer. The Queen of Night and Magic and the Moonlit King each claim dominion in turn, ruling over the Summer and Winter courts respectively.
