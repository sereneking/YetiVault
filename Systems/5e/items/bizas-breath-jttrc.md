# Biza's Breath
*Adventuring Gear, poison*  


A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. The [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature must use its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no other creature within its reach, the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature does nothing on its turn. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
