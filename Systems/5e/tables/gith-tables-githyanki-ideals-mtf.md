`dice: [](gith-tables-githyanki-ideals-mtf.md#^githyanki-ideals)`

| dice: d4 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Fidelity. Warriors are only as good as the vows they keep. |
| 2 | Power. The weak rule the strong. |
| 3 | Duty. It is by Vlaakith's will alone that I act. |
| 4 | Freedom. No strong soul should be enslaved. Better to die first than live as another's puppet. |
