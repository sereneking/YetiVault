# Divine Communications
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

Your connection to your god deepens, granting you these benefits:

- **Ability Score Increase.** Increase the ability score of the spellcasting ability chosen when you gained the Divinely Favored feat by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- **Celestial Tongues.** You learn to speak, read, and write Celestial, and two other languages of your choice.  
- **Divine Omens.** You can cast the [augury](/Systems/5e/spells/augury.md) and [commune](/Systems/5e/spells/commune.md) spell without a spell slot, and you must finish `1d4` long rests before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spell's spellcasting ability is the one chosen when you gained the Divinely Favored feat.
