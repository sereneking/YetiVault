*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self

The billowing flames of a dragon cover your feet, granting you explosive speed. For the duration, your speed increases by 20 feet and moving doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

When you move within 5 feet of a creature or object that isn't being worn or carried, it takes `1d6` fire damage from your trail of heat. A creature or object can take this damage only once during a turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, increase your speed by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 3rd. Additionally, the spell deals an additional `1d6` fire damage for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Artificer](/Systems/5e/classes/artificer-tce.md), [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md), [Sorcerer](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
