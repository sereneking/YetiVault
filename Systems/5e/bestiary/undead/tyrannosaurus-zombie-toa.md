# Tyrannosaurus Zombie
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 241*  

Several new zombie variants are presented below. For more information on zombies, see the Monster Manual.

## Ankylosaurus Zombie

This creature is slow and barely aware of its surroundings.

## Girallon Zombie

Girallons are four-armed apes with white fur. Girallon zombies are slower than their non-undead counterparts but no less fierce. The necromantic energy empowering them fuels their murderous hearts and their hunger for living flesh.

## Tyrannosaurus Zombie

A tyrannosaurus zombie has a gullet full of smaller zombies, which it can disgorge. These zombies aren't under the tyrannosaurus zombie's control.

## Traits

***Disgorge Zombie.*** As a bonus action, the tyrannosaurus zombie can disgorge a normal [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md), which appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. The disgorged [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) acts on its own initiative count. After a zombie is disgorged, roll a `d6`. On a roll of 1, the tyrannosaurus zombie runs out of zombies to disgorge and loses this trait. If the tyrannosaurus zombie still has this trait when it dies, `1d4` normal zombies erupt from its corpse at the start of its next turn. These zombies act on their own initiative count.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the tyrannosaurus zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The tyrannosaurus zombie makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (`4d12 + 7`) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and the tyrannosaurus zombie can't bite another target or disgorge zombies.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d8 + 7`) bludgeoning damage.
