| dice: d8 | Master |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Philia Fjor, a half-elf abjurer who baked cupcakes that functioned as potions. |
| 2 | Oghhga, a mute half-orc diviner who beat her unsuccessful students to death with rocks. |
| 3 | Impler Rickys, a gnome transmuter who lived under a bridge and worked for candied beets and honey peanuts. |
| 4 | Dame Melna Rothburntonberryville, a 238-year-old elf croquet player and evoker, and hero of the first, second, third, fifth, and sixth Troll Wars. (She was out on maternity leave during the fourth.) |
| 5 | Fernstern Drockburn, a deep gnome ventriloquist and conjurer, and his "dummy" Vinceroy, an imp familiar in a puppet suit. |
| 6 | Loa Hatt, a tiefling illusionist and cobbler, whose rumored dealings with devils led to many jokes about fixing soles while destroying souls. |
| 7 | Reni the Hare, a halfling enchanter with an odd fondness for carrots. You ate a lot of carrots as an apprentice. You don't much like carrots anymore. |
| 8 | Sylvester Delague, a human necromancer whose greatest possession was a portrait painted by an ex-student, said to capture his green eyes perfectly. In truth, Sylvester was color-blind, and the portrait's eyes are bloodshot red. No one ever told him. |
