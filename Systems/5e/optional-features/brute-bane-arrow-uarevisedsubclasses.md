# Brute Bane Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses p. 3*  

You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. If your arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra `2d6` necrotic damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the damage of the target's attacks is halved until the next turn.

The necrotic damage increases to `4d6` when you reach 18th level with this class.
