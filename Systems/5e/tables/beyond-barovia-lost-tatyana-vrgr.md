| dice: d6 | Resurrection Circumstances |
|----------|----------------------------|
| 1 | Tatyana's incorporeal spirit assembles and haunts heroes whom she believes have the best chance of defeating Strahd. |
| 2 | A character's friend or loved one is the incarnation of Tatyana. When the Mists claim that individual, the character is drawn into Barovia as well. |
| 3 | A character's own reincarnation allows Tatyana's soul to enter their body, bringing with it memories in the form of vivid dreams. |
| 4 | Tatyana's soul was captured by an effect similar to the [magic jar](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-jar.md) spell. Strahd or another entity hires the characters to seek out the container holding the soul, not revealing its true nature. |
| 5 | Tatyana's soul reincarnated as someone another Darklord covets, such as the bearer of Ankhtepot's ka in "Har'Akir" or [Elise](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/elise-vrgr.md) in "Lamordia" (both detailed later in this chapter). |
| 6 | Tatyana's soul found its way into a distant relative of Strahd, Lyssa von Zarovich. Lyssa seeks to grow more powerful and claim Castle Ravenloft for herself. Her first step to deposing Strahd was to become a [vampire](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/vampire.md). Now she needs allies. |
