## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Serapio has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Serapio makes two Talon attacks.

***Talon.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage plus 14 (`3d8`) poison damage.

***Change Shape.*** Serapio magically transforms into a Medium owl, while retaining its game statistics (other than its size). This transformation ends if Serapio is reduced to 0 hit points or if it uses its action to end it.

***Plague Winds (Fiend Form Only; Recharge 5-6).*** Serapio emits a chilling, disease-ridden wind in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 26 (`4d12`) cold damage and become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned).

While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, the creature can't regain hit points. At the end of every hour, the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). If the creature is in direct sunlight when it makes this saving throw, it automatically succeeds on the save.

If the creature is targeted by magic that ends a poison or disease, such as lesser restoration, while the creature isn't in direct sunlight, the effect does not end.
