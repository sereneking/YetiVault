# Alchemist
*[Artificer](artificer-uaartificer.md): Artificer Specialist*  
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 5*  


## Class Features

### Alchemist (Level 1)

An alchemist is an expert at combining exotic reagents to produce a variety of materials, from healing draughts that can mend a wound in moments to clinging goo that slows creatures down.

### Alchemist's Satchel (Level 1)

At 1st level, you craft an Alchemist's Satchel, a bag of reagents that you use to create a variety of concoctions. The bag and its contents are both magical, and this magic allows you to pull out exactly the right materials you need for your Alchemical Formula options, described below. After you use one of those options, the bag reclaims the materials.

If you lose this satchel, you can create a new one over the course of three days of work (eight hours each day) by expending 100 gp worth of leather, glass, and other raw materials.

### Alchemical Formula (Level 1)

At 1st level, you learn three Alchemical Formula options: Alchemical Fire, Alchemical Acid, and one other option of your choice. You learn an additional formula of your choice at 3rd, 9th, 14th, and 17th levels.

To use any of these options, your Alchemist's Satchel must be within reach.

If an Alchemical Formula option requires a saving throw, the DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.

### Extra Alchemical Formula (Level 3)

At 3rd level, you learn an additional Alchemical Formula.

### Extra Alchemical Formula (Level 9)

At 9th level, you learn an additional Alchemical Formula.

### Extra Alchemical Formula (Level 14)

At 14th level, you learn an additional Alchemical Formula.

### Extra Alchemical Formula (Level 17)

At 17th level, you learn an additional Alchemical Formula.
