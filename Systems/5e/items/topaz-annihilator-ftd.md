# Topaz Annihilator
*Ranged Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 N
- **Range**: 100/300
- **Properties**: [Two-handed](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)

This magic ranged weapon resembles a [musket](/Systems/5e/items/musket.md), but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals `2d6` necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a [true resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/true-resurrection.md) or [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the [disintegrate](/Systems/5e/spells/disintegrate.md) spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
