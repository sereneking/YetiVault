## Cards

### Agdon Longscarf the Harengon
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/001-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

This harengon brigand is an insufferable braggart and a daring thief who's willing to put himself in seemingly precarious situations when he has an audience, confident that his speed and cunning will see him through danger. He leads by example rather than by dictate.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic evil.  
- **Personality Trait.** "Responsibility isn't really my thing."  
- **Ideal.** "What's yours is mine; it's only a matter of time."  
- **Bond.** "I have a reputation to uphold. I can't have it sullied by silly concepts like honesty and generosity."  
- **Flaw.** "My confidence is bound up in my scarf's powers. I'm quite the coward without it."  

### Amidor the Dandelion
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/001-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

This 3-foot-tall talking dandelion finds poetry in everything and is quick to fall head over heels in love. A humble idealist, Amidor never puts its own needs above the needs of others.

- **Alignment.** Neutral good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "My speech drifts into flowery verse, if you'll pardon the pun. Allow me to demonstrate: Do not cry, my love! Let me catch your tears as faeries collect morning dew. Let me lift your spirits like a seed on the breeze!"  
- **Ideal.** "The pursuit of true love compels me! Never shall I wilt if I have such a cause to champion."  
- **Bond.** "The beautiful Pollenella—a vision in stripes."  
- **Flaw.** "I cannot resist a pretty face or a heavenly scent."  

### Alagarthas the Elf Prince
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/001-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

This prince made a bargain with Endelyn Moongrave and is paying the price. He longs to return to his home in the Misty Forest and deal with the threat of an evil green dragon that nests there.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I am an elf, and time is on my side. I refuse to give up—ever."  
- **Ideal.** "The elves of the Misty Forest will lose their homes and likely perish if that green dragon isn't slain or driven off. I shall deal with the dragon before it visits great harm on the forest and my people. That is what a prince is expected to do."  
- **Bond.** "Ah, the Misty Forest! No other wood compares to it in beauty and serenity."  
- **Flaw.** "To relent is to show weakness, and I shall not be seen as weak. It is my destiny to be king."  

### Argantle the Korred Queen
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/001-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

Queen Argantle sports a generous beard and whiskers. Her hair is shorn on one side, from where Endelyn Moongrave recently snipped off the queen's precious, powerful locks. Argantle wears an abundance of shale jewelry that doesn't seem to weigh her down in the least.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "My mood is as stormy as the skies of Yon, and I hurl boulders when I'm angry."  
- **Ideal.** "Bitter End is a raving tyrant. I live in hope that one day we'll be free of that hag."  
- **Bond.** "I have sworn to protect Lockbury Henge, and I'll defend it with every last whisker."  
- **Flaw.** "I am quick to make enemies and slow to make friends."  

### Burly the Bugbear
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/002-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Burly and his brother, Hurly, joined the carnival as youngsters. Hurly disappeared a few months ago, and search parties failed to locate him. Mister Witch and Mister Light convinced Burly to stay with the carnival afterward, rather than continue the search on his own. When he's not straining at some feat of athleticism, he's reading books of poetry.

- **Alignment.** Neutral good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I treat my brain like a muscle and try to keep it strong."  
- **Ideal.** "I keep the peace. I don't advocate violence; I'm just doing my job."  
- **Bond.** "After my brother disappeared, everyone in the carnival was so nice to me. I look out for them."  
- **Flaw.** "Sometimes I forget my own strength and accidentally break things. Especially fragile things."  

### Chucklehead the Goblin
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/002-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Chucklehead's real name is Fug. He has a strong affection for Mishka (the only child in Loomlurch who doesn't fear or mock him) and treats her like a younger sibling. He resists any attempt to remove the maggot that lives in his head, because he fears losing it might turn him back into the uncaring, self-serving person he was previously.

- **Alignment.** Neutral (neutral evil without the maggot).  
- **Personality Trait.** "I get angry when people make fun of my head."  
- **Ideal.** "Not all goblins are the same. I mean, look at me."  
- **Bond.** "Mishka is like my little sister. I don't like how Granny Nightshade treats her."  
- **Flaw.** "The maggot showed me my true self. I'll always love it for that, even as it eats my head."  

### Candlefoot the Mime
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/002-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Candlefoot's appearance is strangely monochromatic, due to the chaotic magic of a reckless sorcerer to whom he was apprenticed in his youth. After fleeing his master, Candlefoot found a home in the Witchlight Carnival. He can communicate only through mime until his stolen voice is retrieved from the kenku warlock, Kettlesteam.

- **Alignment.** Neutral good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I shrug a lot because I'm indecisive."  
- **Ideal.** "Love has the power to conquer all."  
- **Bond.** "My true love, Palasha, means everything to me. I'd live my life's misfortunes a hundred times over if I knew the path that would lead me back to her."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm afraid of my own reflection and avoid looking into mirrors. The Hall of Illusions terrifies me."  

### Clapperclaw the Scarecrow
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/002-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

Despite the loss of its original head, this child-sized scarecrow retains an upbeat demeanor characterized by its affinity for gallows humor. With its long claws and rattling gourd head, Clapperclaw knows it can be off-putting to strangers, and it relies on humor to defuse tension.

- **Alignment.** Lawful neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I'm generally positive, and I make jokes when I'm nervous or sense tension in the air."  
- **Ideal.** "I prefer to keep moving from place to place."  
- **Bond.** "My original head. It was perfect every way. I hope to get it back one day."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm self-conscious about my replacement head."  

### Gleam the Elf Acrobat
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/003-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

Gleam is blessed with kindness, grace, and the power of moonlight. She wears a crescent moon mask and is one-half of an acrobatic duo called the Selenelion twins, alongside Glister, her sunny twin. Gleam wants to reunite with her twin and return to the Witchlight Carnival, where they belong.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I'm shy except when I'm on stage or under the Big Top."  
- **Ideal.** "Everyone should be free to express themselves however they wish."  
- **Bond.** "I love my twin, Glister, with all my heart. I feel incomplete without her."  
- **Flaw.** "I avoid conflict. Even a simple argument leaves me flustered and longing to be elsewhere."  

### Glister the Elf Acrobat
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/003-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

Glister is blessed with confidence, grace, and the power of the sun. She wears a sun mask and is one-half of an acrobatic duo called the Selenelion twins, alongside Gleam, her shy twin. Glister is content to remain Endelyn's "guest" in Motherhorn if it means her sibling is safe from the hag's wickedness.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I like to play with fire. I'm confident and take risks, even when the odds are stacked against me."  
- **Ideal.** "Everyone should be free to express themselves however they wish."  
- **Bond.** "I would sacrifice everything to protect my twin."  
- **Flaw.** "When I'm not the center of attention, I become sullen and moody."  

### Hurly the Bugbear
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/004-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

Hurly's brusque nature and short temper made life in the Witchlight Carnival hard for him. His prickly demeanor stems from the fact that he lacks the talent to be what he wants to be: an entertainer. Mister Witch and Mister Light gave him menial jobs because they knew his limitations. By allowing him to perform in her theater, Endelyn Moongrave confirmed what Hurly knew to be true: that Witch and Light were right all along.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "If 'dumb brute' is the only role I can play well, I guess that's what I'll be."  
- **Ideal.** "People might pretend to care about you, but when the play is over, they show you their true selves, and it's never pretty."  
- **Bond.** "I miss my brother."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm quick to lose my temper."  

### Kettlesteam the Kenku
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/004-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Kettlesteam delights in causing trouble at the carnival. She uses a combination of mimicry and conjured illusions to communicate; she has overheard so many conversations that she can talk in one of several different voices.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I'm stubborn as a dog gnawing a bone (mimics the sound of a dog gnawing a bone)."  
- **Ideal.** "Malicious joy. I can't help but chuckle when people mess up (mimics the sound of someone stumbling and others laughing)."  
- **Bond.** "I have a fey pact with Zybilna of Prismeer (mimics the sound of the wind blowing through willows and faraway tinkling bells)."  
- **Flaw.** "I have a volatile temper (mimics the sound of a kettle boiling over)."  

### Jingle Jangle the Goblin
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/004-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

Jingle Jangle is a kind soul who refers to herself in the third person. She has a knack for finding keys and is thrilled to add new ones to her collection. She also gives keys as gifts to those who need them.

Jingle Jangle seeks a quiet life far away from locked doors and the intrigues of the fey courts. She moved to Telemy Hill to enjoy the hill's companionship and protection.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "Jingle Jangle is thorough and fastidious. No cutting corners."  
- **Ideal.** "Revel in your uniqueness, whether you're a goblin who likes keys or an awakened hill with talking trees."  
- **Bond.** "Jingle Jangle keeps her keys shiny and clean."  
- **Flaw.** "Jingle Jangle is frightened by locked doors!"  

### Mister Light
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/004-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Mister Light is the face of the Witchlight Carnival. He's a loud, flamboyant ringleader who'll do anything to maintain the carnival's happy atmosphere.

Mister Light wears a harlequin suit and a jaunty hat. When he presides over the carnival's Big Top, he sparkles like a disco ball.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "There's always something for me to smile about."  
- **Ideal.** "Delight. I want everyone to feel the wonder that I feel each day in this place."  
- **Bond.** "Mister Witch is my greatest friend and most trusted confidant."  
- **Flaw.** "I was the crueler of the two of us, long ago. Perhaps that streak of violence hasn't quite left me."  

### Mister Witch
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/005-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Mister Witch is businesslike and humorless as he deals with staff and keeps the carnival running on schedule. A smile on his visage is a rare event, and it fades quickly.

Mister Witch dresses with panache, though in muted tones, and always carries his magic pocket watch.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I carefully consider my words before speaking them aloud."  
- **Ideal.** "Caution. Thoughtless decisions lead to reckless acts."  
- **Bond.** "This carnival is our opportunity for a new life, far away from the gloomy world we came from."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm too confident in my own authority to see the seeds of doubt in the carnival staff."  

### Nib the Miser
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/005-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Nib (whose real name is Meryl Caberstock) is a tall, rake-thin, elderly man dressed in threadbare finery and a housecoat. He wears a blindfold to avoid glimpsing the apparitions that curse him, but their presence still unnerves him.

- **Alignment.** Neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I speak in a trembling voice and jump at the slightest shadow."  
- **Ideal.** "I seek atonement. I was the worst of Waterdeep's slumlords: ruthless, miserly, and coldhearted. I suppose I'd better do some good before I die."  
- **Bond.** "My spinning wheel is the key to my redemption."  
- **Flaw.** "Yes, I'm scared. If you'd done all the things I've done, you'd be scared too."  

### Morgort the Bullywug Knight
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/005-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

The Knight of Warts is known for her skill at piloting balloons. Justice and moral clarity guide her every action. Despite being held prisoner for treason, she claims that her honor remains intact. Even if it means losing her title, she refuses to bow to King Gullop XIX or renounce her friend and companion, Wigglewog, with whom she conspired to help Sir Talavar escape Bavlorna's clutches.

- **Alignment.** Lawful good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I spit whenever I hear a coward or a liar speak."  
- **Ideal.** "Honor is what makes a knight, even beyond duty or prowess with a weapon."  
- **Bond.** "Ballooning. There's nothing quite like taking flight in a balloon and going where the winds take you."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm a snob who criticizes the state and quality of weapons wielded by others."  

### Northwind the Treant Sapling
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/005-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Northwind embodies the joys of spring, finding childlike wonder in everything from a story told by a stranger to a drop of morning dew. The sapling hails from a line of Feywild treants and travels as the Witchlight Carnival's landscaper, laying down silk ribbons to form rivers and planting acorns that grow rapidly into splendid oak trees.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I love to hear stories. Tell me everything!"  
- **Ideal.** "Joy. Just look at the world around us! Isn't it amazing?"  
- **Bond.** "My ancestors. One day I will grow into an enormous tree and they will be so proud!"  
- **Flaw.** "Oops! I simply cannot keep a secret."  

### Palasha the Mermaid
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/006-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Palasha is an elegant and operatic mermaid whose long fins billow even when she's not underwater. She sculpts water with her extraordinary voice, creating astounding displays of aquatic magic. Palasha's distant yet demanding nature has earned her a reputation for being haughty, but really, she's just slow to trust.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I click my fingers at those around me when I want something."  
- **Ideal.** "I strive to bring beauty and wonder into this world with the power of my voice."  
- **Bond.** "Candlefoot. I can be myself around him."  
- **Flaw.** "I have trouble showing my true feelings, which makes me seem aloof."  

### Shon the Hunchback
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/006-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 5: PALACE OF HEART'S DESIRE

Shon knows that Zybilna is the archmage Iggwilv in a new form—a change for the better, in his estimation. He would never cross Zybilna, to whom he owes his career.

Shon and his "hump" (a [giant wolf spider](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-wolf-spider.md) named Gray that rides on Shon's back) are never apart for very long.

- **Alignment.** Neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I like books more than people."  
- **Ideal.** "Knowledge is a great thing, but not in the hands of imbeciles and bullies. Knowledge must be protected from those who would abuse it."  
- **Bond.** "I look after Gray, and Gray looks after me."  
- **Flaw.** "If you're put off by my abrasiveness, know that I couldn't care less. I don't need any more friends."  

### Pincushion the Living Doll
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/006-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Pincushion is Skabatha Nightshade's childhood doll—an animated nanny brought to life by Baba Yaga to help educate Skabatha. The doll's magic has kept it well preserved, despite its great age. Granny Nightshade has put Pincushion in charge of producing fabric for her toy workshop—a job the doll considers beneath it.

- **Alignment.** Neutral evil.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I behave like the conceited mistress of a high-society fashion house."  
- **Ideal.** "I want Skabatha to respect all I've done for her."  
- **Bond.** "Nobody knows more about fashion than I do."  
- **Flaw.** "I crave flattery."  

### Sir Talavar the Faerie Dragon
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/006-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

Sir Talavar is an esteemed member of the Seelie Court and a loyal vassal of the Summer Queen. Many of Sir Talavar's squires have gone on to become knights of great renown. The venerable faerie dragon has an encouraging, can-do demeanor and an unwavering sense of honor.

- **Alignment.** Lawful good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "My speech is riddled with references to adventures I have undertaken."  
- **Ideal.** "A little kindness goes a long way."  
- **Bond.** "I am but a humble vassal of Her Magnificence, the Summer Queen."  
- **Flaw.** "My knightly oaths are tested most strongly by my craving for hard candy."  

### Sowpig the Ghoul
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/007-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL & CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Skabatha Nightshade encountered this small ghoul while collecting grave dust in a cemetery on the Material Plane. The hag brought Sowpig to Loomlurch and fed her bowls of carrion. Sowpig lures children from the Witchlight Carnival into the hag's clutches so that Granny Nightshade can put them to work in her toy shop.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic evil.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I tend to stand silently, staring and saying nothing."  
- **Ideal.** "Children need work to keep them out of trouble. Those toys aren't going to make themselves."  
- **Bond.** "I serve Granny, who made me what I am today. I would never betray her."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm a soulless husk incapable of remorse."  

### Stagefright the Goblin
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/007-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 4: YON

This goblin's real name is Onk. He oversees the goblin laborers who work behind the scenes at Motherhorn. He also serves as the theater's master of ceremonies.

Stagefright carries a fool's scepter topped with a visage similar to his, and he talks to the inanimate scepter as if it were alive (which it is not). Arguments between the two—or, more precisely, Stagefright and himself—always end with Stagefright bashing the scepter's head against something hard.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "My scepter would have you believe it can do a better job than I can, but time and again, I prove it wrong."  
- **Ideal.** "Chaos! I thrive in it."  
- **Bond.** "The stage is my world. Without it, I wither."  
- **Flaw.** "I treat everyone like props."  

### Squirt the Oilcan
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/007-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Originally a nonsentient oilcan, Squirt was carried to the Feywild by dwarves hoping to harvest boggle oil. Though the expedition was a success, the dwarves were put to sleep by pixie magic. During a celebration that erupted around them, an elf used her magic to animate the oilcan in jest. Having come alive at a party, Squirt was imbued with the urge to seek out fun wherever it can be found.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "Why do something yourself when you can have someone else do it for you?"  
- **Ideal.** "No use sitting about getting rusty when there's fun to be had. Let's party!"  
- **Bond.** "I'm running on fumes here. I need oil."  
- **Flaw.** "I'm too tired to fly today. You carry me."  

### Thaco the Clown
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/007-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 1: WITCHLIGHT CARNIVAL

Thaco is the longest-serving Witchlight hand, but no one really knows his history and scarcely any dare to ask, for he almost never speaks and harbors a malicious streak that is kept in check by Mister Witch. He paints his face with a grin and puffs on a bubble pipe. Thaco has retired from performing and no longer stages his knife-throwing act due to an unfortunate incident that took place in the Big Top some time ago.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I prefer not to talk. When I must, I say as little as possible."  
- **Ideal.** "Everyone should mind their own business."  
- **Bond.** "My bubble pipe—if anyone touches it, they lose a finger."  
- **Flaw.** "I can't stand children. They're like roaches."  

### Thinnings the Butler
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/008-1.webp#card)
CHAPTER 5: PALACE OF HEART'S DESIRE

Zybilna's butler appears as a lanky man clad in faded brown clothes. Thinnings longs to see Prismeer's archfey freed from temporal stasis and her enemies fed their comeuppance. He helps anyone whose goals align with his own, but he abhors violence and shuns combat.

- **Alignment.** Neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I crave secrets."  
- **Ideal.** "Hospitality, ownership, reciprocity—the rules of conduct must be respected."  
- **Bond.** "I have pledged my fealty to Zybilna of Prismeer, and I am nothing if not her loyal servant."  
- **Flaw.** "Don't expect me to come to your rescue. I didn't get this far by being brave or foolhardy."  

### Will of the Feywild
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/008-2.webp#card)
CHAPTER 3: THITHER

Will looks like an 11-year-old lad dressed in a homemade tunic and a spider silk cloak. He is the polymorphed form of an oni named Mugan, who served Granny Nightshade until a curse changed his alignment from lawful evil to chaotic good. Will's time in the forests of Thither has imbued him with a personality common among fairykind: boastful, impulsive, and full of mirth.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I like to strike a different pose with every sentence I speak."  
- **Ideal.** "Every child must dash free and wild, like me!"  
- **Bond.** "For the Getaway Gang to flourish, we need more members. Not adults, mind you, just kids like me!"  
- **Flaw.** "I'm as stubborn and slippery as a toad. I won't and I shan't, but I will if I can't!"  

### Vansel the Satyr
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/008-3.webp#card)
CHAPTER 2: HITHER

The satyr Vansel is a vagabond who travels the Feywild in a constant state of amusement at whatever befalls him. He enjoys bathing and splashing in water, picking flowers, and eating wild mushrooms. He has no shame with regard to who he is and what he looks like, and he has a knack for small talk, reveling in the opportunity to chat with anyone about anything.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic good.  
- **Personality Trait.** "Nothing dampens my spirits."  
- **Ideal.** "There's fun and delight to be found in every experience."  
- **Bond.** "Wonders abound in the Feywild, and I would never dream of leaving it."  
- **Flaw.** "I laugh in the face of danger, often to my detriment."  

### Zybilna of Prismeer
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WBtW/Roleplaying%20Cards/008-4.webp#card)
CHAPTER 5: PALACE OF HEART'S DESIRE

Iggwilv was a brilliant, calculating figure hardly prone to emotional outbursts, but as Zybilna, she allows her emotions to run rampant and is more likely to find herself in the grip of happiness, anger, or melancholy. This is the price she pays to exert control over the Feywild and impose her will on the domain of Prismeer.

- **Alignment.** Chaotic neutral.  
- **Personality Trait.** "I have become more temperamental in my old age."  
- **Ideal.** "I used to believe that emotions and kindness were signs of weakness. Now I see their strength."  
- **Bond.** "Prismeer is my home now."  
- **Flaw.** "My mother, Baba Yaga, warned me that arrogance would be my undoing, 'as sure as stars light the night sky.' She might be right."
