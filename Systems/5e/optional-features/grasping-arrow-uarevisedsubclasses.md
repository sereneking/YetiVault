# Grasping Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses p. 3*  

When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, thorny brambles that wrap around the target. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra `2d6` poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes `2d6` slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.

The poison and slashing damage both increase to `4d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
