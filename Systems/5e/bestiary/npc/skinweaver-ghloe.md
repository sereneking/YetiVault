## Salvage

Skinweavers collect valuable artwork and other items that display their erudition and refinement. They're never without their custom-made suits of bespoke leather armor. This leather is so finely crafted that a suit of armor stitched from a skinweaver's own suit is better than almost any other tanner's creations.

If a proficient armorer or leather worker uses a skinweaver's suit to create a humanoid suit of light armor and succeeds on a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check, the armor acts as [+1 leather armor](/Systems/5e/items/1-armor.md) and can be donned or doffed as a standard action. This process takes 24 hours and requires 250 gp of other components.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** A skinweaver is resistant to fire damage because of its leathery skin and armor.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** A skinweaver's terrifying appearance can scare an opponent multiple times in the same fight.

## Traits

***Supernaturally Sharp.*** Skinweaver's tanning knives overcome slashing damage resistance (though not immunity).

***Shocking Visage.*** Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the skinweaver and can see it must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) until the end of the creature's next turn). Whether a creature succeeds or fails, it cannot be affected by this ability again until it loses sight of the skinweaver (as when the skinweaver moves behind total cover or successfully hides).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The skinweaver makes two tanning knife attacks or one tanning knife and one web whip attack.

***Tanning Knife.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d8 + 2`) slashing damage.

***Web Whip.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* Attack: `+4` to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) piercing damage, and the target is pulled up to 20 feet toward the skinweaver.

***Web Net (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by leathery webbing. As an action, the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can attempt a DC 13 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 10; vulnerability to slashing damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
