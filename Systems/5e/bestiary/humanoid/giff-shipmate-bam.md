## Traits

***Firearms Knowledge.*** The giff's mastery of its weapons enables it to ignore the loading property of any firearm.

***Steady as She Goes.*** On the deck of a ship, the giff has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made against effects that would knock it [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) or shove it overboard.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giff makes two Longsword or Musket attacks.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage, or 9 (`1d10 + 4`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Musket.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 40/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d12 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Force Grenade.*** The giff throws a grenade up to 60 feet, and the grenade explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the giff throws the grenade, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 4 or lower, the giff has no more grenades to throw.
