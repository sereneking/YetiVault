`dice: [](ship-quirks-aag.md#^ship-quirks)`

| dice: d10 | Quirk |
|-----------|-------|
| 1 | A chatty but harmless spirit haunts the cargo hold. |
| 2 | The excessive creaking of the hull echoes throughout the ship. |
| 3 | Any creature that removes itself from the ship's [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) receives a startling but harmless magical shock. |
| 4 | The ship's companionways are smaller than those found in most other similar vessels. |
| 5 | The ship makes a groaning sound in what seems like defiance whenever it comes to a stop. |
| 6 | The floor of the main deck is adorned with a stylized rendering of a mysterious star chart that pulsates occasionally with scintillating colors. |
| 7 | The ship's air envelope has a salty, briny smell. |
| 8 | Bulkheads throughout the ship have lines of poetry scrawled on them. |
| 9 | Unattended tools often go missing, only to reappear `1d4` hours later in another part of the ship. |
| 10 | A creature seated in the ship's [spelljamming helm](/Systems/5e/items/spelljamming-helm-aag.md) hears faint spacefaring chanteys in its mind except when the ship is under attack. |
