Brimming with innovative ideas and reckless enthusiasm, the inventors of Mount Nevermind love any chance to showcase their creations. These talented inventors use their cleverness and technological know-how to outwit foes.

## Nevermind Gnomes

Mount Nevermind is a hollow, dormant volcano on the island of Sancrist in Krynn. Within the mountain, a vibrant community of rock gnome tinkerers and other inventors relentlessly study various scientific pursuits to create mechanical marvels.

## Traits

***Always Thinking Ahead.*** The inventor has advantage on initiative rolls.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The inventor makes two Flying Fangtrap attacks. It can replace one of these attacks with Thunderscream Gadget if it's available.

***Flying Fangtrap.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) piercing damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of the inventor's next turn.

***Thunderscream Gadget (Recharge 5-6).*** The inventor produces a gadget that emits a screeching wave of sound in a 30-foot cone originating from the inventor. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reactions

***Flash Powder.*** If the inventor is damaged by a creature it can see within 15 feet of itself, the inventor retaliates by flinging brilliantly explosive powder at the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of its next turn.
