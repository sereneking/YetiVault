| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Curiosity. I might never be able to experience everything in the multiverseâ€”but it doesn't hurt to try. (Any) |
| 2 | Nonviolence. Violence need never be the answer in a multiverse of infinite possibilities. (Neutral) |
| 3 | Whimsy. Why waste time on boring, ordinary concerns when the world is filled with fantastic and ludicrous wonders? (Chaotic) |
| 4 | Beauty. There is beauty to be found in even the simplest things if you look hard enough. (Good) |
| 5 | Inspiration. Great are history's artists and creators. But greater still are those who inspire them. (Any) |
| 6 | Power. Creatures are at their most vulnerable in their dreams, and I am the master of dreams. (Evil) |
