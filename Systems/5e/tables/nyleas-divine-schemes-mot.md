**Nylea's Divine Schemes**

| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | When the polis of Meletis expands, clearing new land for houses and crops, Nylea decides to punish the polis and destroy it if necessary. Animated trees topple the walls, and Nyxborn beasts invade the city. |
| 2 | Nylea refuses to turn winter into spring unless Karametra agrees to abolish agriculture and yield all cropland back to the forest. |
| 3 | When tensions between Akros and Setessa peak, Nylea blames Iroas for stirring up the conflict and puts Setessa under her protection, expanding the borders of the Nessian Wood to encompass all of Setessa, creating a near-impenetrable fortress filled with dangerous creatures. |
| 4 | Nylea abruptly vanishes. Explorers deep in the Nessian Wood discover her sacred grove abandoned, and the giant chrysalis at its heart empty. What was in the chrysalis? Could it have harmed Nylea? Or did she leave with the creatureâ€”and if so, did she do that to protect the creature, or to protect Theros? |
