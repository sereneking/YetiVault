## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Lowarnizel can breathe both air and water.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** Lowarnizel casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):

**1/day each**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md), [protection from evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md), [sending](/Systems/5e/spells/sending.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Lowarnizel makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) force damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Singularity Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Lowarnizel creates a shining bead of gravitational force, then releases the energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (`8d8`) force damage, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of the dragon's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

## Bonus Actions

***Change Shape.*** Lowarnizel magically transforms into any creature that is Medium or Small, while retaining his game statistics (other than his size). This transformation ends if the dragon is reduced to 0 hit points or uses a bonus action to end it.
