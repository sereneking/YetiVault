| 1 | An [adult topaz dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-topaz-dragon-ftd.md) vies with a [storm giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) over territory. The giant keeps live seafood in a tide pool, and the dragon keeps drying out the pool in an effort to drive the giant away. |
| 2 | An [adult topaz dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-topaz-dragon-ftd.md) and an [adult bronze dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-bronze-dragon.md) are finding their centuries-old enmity turning into a more romantic passion. |
| 3 | A [djinni](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/djinni.md) hopes to convince a topaz dragon to tolerate the djinni's presence by driving off a clan of [cyclopes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/cyclops.md) harassing the dragon. |
| 4 | Reunited after years apart, an [adult topaz dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-topaz-dragon-ftd.md) parent and young dragon child realize they enjoy hunting together. |
| 5 | A tempestuous [marid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/marid.md) continually floods the carefully dried-out lair of a topaz dragon. |
| 6 | A [sahuagin baron](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin-baron.md) attempts to gain the support of other sahuagin for driving away a topaz dragon attempting to claim the sea devils' territory. |
| 7 | A pirate captain tells stories of an [adult topaz dragon's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-topaz-dragon-ftd.md) legendary hoard while attempting to gather a crew to raid the dragon's lair. |
| 8 | A ship wrecks near an [adult topaz dragon's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/adult-topaz-dragon-ftd.md) lair. The dragon claims what's left of the cargo and tries to ransom the survivors (including the dragonborn ship captain) back to the city they came from. |
