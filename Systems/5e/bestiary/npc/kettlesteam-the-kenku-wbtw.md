# Kettlesteam the Kenku
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 52*  

Kettlesteam the kenku snoops around the carnival under the cover of a [disguise self](/Systems/5e/spells/disguise-self.md) spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions "earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.

## Traits

***Mimicry.*** Kettlesteam can mimic any sounds she has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations only with a successful DC 13 Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

***Spellcasting.*** Kettlesteam casts one of the following spells, using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 13):

**At will**: [disguise self](/Systems/5e/spells/disguise-self.md), [friends](/Systems/5e/spells/friends.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1/day each**: [bestow curse](/Systems/5e/spells/bestow-curse.md), [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md), [speak with animals](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-animals.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Kettlesteam makes two Dagger attacks.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Twilight Sleep (2/Day).*** Kettlesteam targets one creature she can see within 10 feet of her. The target is engulfed in a cloud of magical, sleep-inducing gas and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute. A creature put to sleep by this gas awakens instantly if it takes damage, or if someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake.
