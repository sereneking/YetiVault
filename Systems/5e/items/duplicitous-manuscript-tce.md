# Duplicitous Manuscript
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

To you, this book is a magical spellbook. To anyone else, the book appears to be a volume of verbose romance fiction. As an action, you can change the book's appearance and alter the plot of the romance.

When found, the book contains the following spells: [hallucinatory terrain](/Systems/5e/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md), [major image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md), [mirror image](/Systems/5e/spells/mirror-image.md), [mislead](/Systems/5e/spells/mislead.md), [Nystul's magic aura](/Systems/5e/spells/nystuls-magic-aura.md), [phantasmal force](/Systems/5e/spells/phantasmal-force.md), and [silent image](/Systems/5e/spells/silent-image.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the illusion school.  
- When a creature you can see makes an Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern the true nature of an illusion spell you cast, or makes a saving throw against an illusion spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the roll.
