# Hrabbaz
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 205*  

Hrabbaz is a muscle-bound half-orc with a cleft palate who serves the lord and lady of House Gralhund as a bodyguard. He is well mannered and dresses impeccably-a disarming appearance that belies a murderous heart. Though he has great respect for Lady Yalah Gralhund, he is less fond of her moody husband, and wouldn't be sad to see Orond knocked down a peg or two.
