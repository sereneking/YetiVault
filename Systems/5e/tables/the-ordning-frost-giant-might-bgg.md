| dice: d6 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Planning to claim all the credit, a frost giant seeks the help of powerful adventurers to defeat a foe the giant could never handle alone. |
| 2 | A frost giant wants help obtaining a [manual of gainful exercise](/Systems/5e/items/manual-of-gainful-exercise.md) believed to be in a dragon's hoard. |
| 3 | A low-ranking frost giant prefers to be surrounded with weaker creatures and so leads a band of Humanoid brigands. A merchant council asks for aid against them. |
| 4 | A frost giant keeps a defeated foe's head as a trophy; the foe's family wants justice—and the head back—and asks adventurers for help. |
| 5 | Two groups of frost giants meet near a mountain pass. When their wrestling matches cause avalanches, travelers who rely on the pass ask for help. |
| 6 | A frost giant destroys works of Humanoid construction—such as bridges, barns, and walls—as a show of strength. Affected farmers beg for help. |
