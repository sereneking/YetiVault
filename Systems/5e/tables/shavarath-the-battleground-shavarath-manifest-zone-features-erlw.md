**Shavarath Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](shavarath-the-battleground-shavarath-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^shavarath-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Blades crafted here have a reputation for being especially fine and sharp. When a creature in the zone scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, the attack deals one additional die of damage. |
| 2 | Blood spilled here never washes away. Any Charisma checks made in the zone to avoid hostility are made with disadvantage; Charisma checks made to encourage violence are always successful. |
| 3 | Storms of whirling blades cut the sky during times of combat, randomly attacking the participants. The effect is the same as that of the [cloud of daggers](/Systems/5e/spells/cloud-of-daggers.md) spell, but the area and the damage might both increase. |
| 4 | Devils, demons, and angels duel in the remains of a ruined fortress that serves as a portal to Shavarath. |
