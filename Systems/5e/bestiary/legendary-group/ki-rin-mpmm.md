# Ki-rin

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a kirin can take one of the following lair actions, and it must finish a long rest before taking the chosen lair action again:

- **Create Comforts.** The ki-rin conjures up one or more permanent objects made of soft, plant-based material—including manufactured objects like pillows, rope, blankets, and clothing—that can collectively fill no more than a 20-foot cube. The objects materialize 1 minute later in unoccupied spaces of the ki-rin's choice on the floor of the lair.  
- **Create Stone and Metal.** The ki-rin conjures up one or more temporary objects made of stone or metal that can collectively fill no more than a 2-foot cube. The objects materialize 1 minute later in unoccupied spaces of the ki-rin's choice on the floor of the lair, and the objects vanish after 1 hour.  
- **Create Wood.** The ki-rin conjures up one or more permanent objects made of wood, or similarly hard plant-based material, that can collectively fill no more than a 10-foot cube. The objects materialize 1 minute later in unoccupied spaces of the ki-rin's choice on the floor of the lair.  

## Regional effects

A ki-rin's Celestial nature transforms the region around its lair. Any of the following magical effects is possible for travelers to encounter in the vicinity:

- **Blessed Nature.** Beasts, Plants, and Celestials within 3 miles of the ki-rin's lair grow more vigorous as they evolve toward an idealized form. Such creatures are rarely aggressive toward others that aren't normally prey.  
- **Controlled Weather.** A ki-rin can cast [control weather](/Systems/5e/spells/control-weather.md) while it is within 3 miles of its lair. The spell's point of origin is always the point outdoors closest to the center of its lair. The ki-rin doesn't need to maintain a clear path to the sky or to concentrate for the change in weather to persist.  
- **Pure Waters.** Water flows pure within 3 miles of a ki-rin's lair. Any purposeful corruption of the water lasts for no longer than 3 minutes.  
- **Realm of Respite.** Curses, diseases, and poisons on creatures are suppressed when those creatures are within 3 miles of the lair, unless the creatures are Aberrations, Fiends, or Undead.  
- **Safe Descents.** Within 3 miles of the lair, winds buoy creatures that fall due to no act of the ki-rin or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage. Aberrations, Fiends, and Undead don't gain this benefit, falling as normal.  

When the ki-rin dies, all these effects disappear immediately, although the invigorating effect on flora and fauna remains for 3 years.
