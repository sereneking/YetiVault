## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dracolich fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The dracolich has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dracolich can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`2d10 + 8`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d6 + 8`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+14` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dracolich's choice that is within 120 feet of the dracolich and aware of it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dracolich's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dracolich exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (`18d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** The dracolich makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Tail Attack.*** The dracolich makes a tail attack.

***Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The dracolich beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dracolich must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (`2d6 + 8`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The dracolich can then fly up to half its flying speed.
