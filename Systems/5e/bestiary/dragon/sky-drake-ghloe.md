# Sky Drake
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 63*  

> [!quote]-

> Descendants of the great dragons of the mythic past still roam Etharis. They have little of the majesty of their ancestors, but they're still frightening.

## Salvage

Dragons are rare on Etharis, so materials from their corpses fetch a good price. A dragon's corpse can be sold for at least 100 gp times the Challenge of the monster.

## Lore

- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Sea drakes are cunning grapplers resistant to cold, sky drakes are adept fliers and have a bite charged with lightning, and blight drakes collect diseases that don't kill them but make for a toxic bite.
