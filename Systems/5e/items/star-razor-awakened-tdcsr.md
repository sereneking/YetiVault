> Many weapons created by mortals during the Age of Arcanum were designed with hopes to surpass or even destroy the gods, but not so with Dwueth'var. That shining sword, bright with the light of the bold full moon and the enigmatic starlit night, was forged by acolytes of the Wildmother and the Moonweaver, united in their love of this fragile world and their determination to protect it.

The thick, grooved blade of this shining silver [longsword](/Systems/5e/items/longsword.md) is lined with etched runes that sparkle blue in the light. Star Razor—known also as Dwueth'var—was thought to have been destroyed or lost after the "Calamity", but new rumors suggest that it might be wielded by a half-orc somewhere in "Wildemount".

## Dormant

While Star Razor is in a dormant state, you can hold this magic longsword and use a bonus action to speak the command word *Galas-var*, causing the sword to emit a pale blue glow that sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. This glow lasts until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, or until you drop or sheathe the sword.

- While this longsword is glowing, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon, and you have resistance to radiant damage.  
- You can cast the [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md) spell from the weapon as an action, requiring no components (save DC 13). Once a spell has been cast using Star Razor, that spell can't be cast from the sword until the next dawn.  

## Awakened

When Star Razor reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The weapon's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to +2.  
- When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to create a burst of radiance from the sword, dealing `1d8` radiant damage to the attacker.  
- You can cast the [see invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell from the sword as an action, and the save DC for spells cast using the sword increases to 15.
