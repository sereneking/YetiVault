| 1 | A battle standard showing the coat of arms of an ancient realm the dragon failed to protect |
| 2 | A dragonchess set with the white knights replaced by the symbols of a war god; the board is set up for the start of a new game, and the dragon has been waiting decades for the god to make the first move |
| 3 | A large tapestry depicting a bloody battle between two realms of the surface world; the dragon claims it is the tiny dragon embroidered in one corner |
| 4 | A music box that plays a haunting song; the dragon claims the music is very popular on another world |
| 5 | A necklace made from discarded sapphire dragon horn tips and tail barbs; the dragon refuses to say whether the pieces were donated willingly |
| 6 | A perfectly polished mirror that the dragon spends hours staring into, hoping to catch glimpses into other worlds |
