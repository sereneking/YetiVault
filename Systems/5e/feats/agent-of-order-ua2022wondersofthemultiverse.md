# Agent Of Order
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You can channel cosmic forces of order that lock the multiverse into patterns. Your actions are your own to choose, but these forces grant you the following benefits:

- **Stasis Strike.** Once per turn when you damage a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can deal an extra `1d8` force damage to the target, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + the modifier of the ability score increased by this feat) or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by spectral bindings until the start of your next turn. These bindings manifest as chains, gears, encasing stone, or some other symbol of stasis. You can use this benefit a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
