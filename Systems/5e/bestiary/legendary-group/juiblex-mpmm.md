# Juiblex

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Juiblex can take one of the following lair actions; it can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Green Slime.** A [green slime](/Systems/5e/traps-hazards/green-slime.md) (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) appears on a spot on the ceiling that Juiblex chooses within the lair. The slime disintegrates after 1 hour.  
- **Slippery Slime.** Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. When the slime appears, each creature on it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) and slide 10 feet in a random direction determined by a `d8` roll. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save.  

    The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.  
- **Sticky Slime.** Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. When the slime appears, each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save.  

    A [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature is stuck as long as it remains in the slimy area or until it breaks free. The [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature, or another creature that can reach it, can use its action to try to break free and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength check. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

The region containing Juiblex's lair is warped by its magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Acidic Water.** Small bodies of water, such as ponds or wells, within 1 mile of the lair turn highly acidic, corroding any object that touches them.  
- **Corrupted Nature.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) and Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks have disadvantage.  
- **Slime.** Surfaces within 6 miles of the lair are frequently covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.  

If Juiblex dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
