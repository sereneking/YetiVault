# Charm of the Sun

You learn the [Light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md) cantrip if you don't already know it. You can cast [Sunburst](/Systems/5e/spells/sunburst.md), requiring no spell components and using your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice). Once used, the charm vanishes from you, and you unlearn the [Light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md) cantrip gained from this charm.
