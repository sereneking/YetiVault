# Knifewing
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 15*  

A knifewing is a gliding lizard about the size of a small dog. Its gliding flaps have hard edges that are sharp while stretched taut when the lizard glides.

## Salvage

The skin of a knifewing is prized for making a [knifewing cape](/Systems/5e/items/knifewing-cape-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis).
