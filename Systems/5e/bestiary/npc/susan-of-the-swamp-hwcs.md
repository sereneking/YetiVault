# Susan of the Swamp
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 198*  

Susan is an eccentric hedge whose magical aptitude has always been outclassed by her hunger for knowledge. She studied at the Avium for a short time, but left of her own accord to experiment with magics the Avium found unsavory. Susan recently settled in the swamp in the hopes of pursuing her arcane curiosities in peace. She shares her modest home with her beetle familiar, Normal, and spends her time foraging for ingredients, testing spells, and reading mystery novels in addition to tomes of eldritch lore. Though she performs her rituals a safe distance away from the cities and towns, her presence in the region has made the Magistrate of Winnowing Reach uneasy, and he wants her gone. Susan uses the [hedge witch](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/hedge-witch-hwcs.md) stat block. Her alignment is chaotic good.

## Traits

***Dark One's Blessing.*** When Susan reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains 5 temporary hit points.

***Repelling Blast.*** When Susan hits a creature with eldritch blast, she can push the creature up to 10 feet away in a straight line.

***Spellcasting.*** Susan is a 2nd-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks). Susan has the following warlock spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md)

**1st-1st level (2 slots)**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [hellish rebuke](/Systems/5e/spells/hellish-rebuke.md), [unseen servant](/Systems/5e/spells/unseen-servant.md)

## Actions

***Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+1` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 2 (`1d6 - 1`) bludgeoning damage.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Fiendish Vigor.*** Susan can cast [false life](/Systems/5e/spells/false-life.md) at will as a 1st-level spell.

***Curl Up.*** Susan curls up into a spiny ball. While curled up in this way she cannot move, attack, or cast spells with somatic components, and her base armor class becomes 19. Any creature that misses Susan with a melee attack while she is curled up takes `2d4` points of piercing damage from her sharp quills. If a creature hits Susan while she is curled up, however, Susan is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in her space at the end of the turn. Susan may uncurl herself at any point during her turn.
