# Curse Bringer
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade, "The Hexblade" Patron

You can create a greatsword forged from silver, with black runes etched into its blade, using your Pact of the Blade feature. If you reduce a target cursed by your Hexblade's Curse to 0 hit points with this sword, you can immediately change the target of the curse to a different creature. This change doesn't extend the curse's duration.

When you hit a creature with this weapon, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional `2d8` slashing damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature's speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.
