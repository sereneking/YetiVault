|----------|-------|
| 1 | If you're not a thief or a frost giant, let's talk! |
| 2 | Are you comfortable? Can I tell your future for you? Just let me know what I can do for you, okay? |
| 3 | Jokes are as valuable as any gemstone and more fun to share. |
| 4 | My empathy is a bottomless well. I can't help but lose myself in the emotions of others. |
| 5 | The stars have much to tell us, and folk need me to interpret what the stars say. |
| 6 | All play and no workâ€”those are the words I live by. |
| 7 | I am always the first to offer a compliment. |
| 8 | Get off my snowfield, you immature bipeds! When I was a wyrmling, people respected their elders! |
