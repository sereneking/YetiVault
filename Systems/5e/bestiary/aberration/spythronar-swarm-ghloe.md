# Spythronar Swarm

## Salvage

Spythronar silk is prized, although it's worthless if acid or fire touched the web. One web can be used to make silk rope or fine clothing. A proficient alchemist can use the same amount of silk to produce a [potion of lightning resistance](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-lightning-resistance.md) or a dose of an oil that allows a metal weapon to deal `1d6` extra lightning damage for 1 hour. Producing either concoction takes 4 hours of work and a successful DC 13 Intelligence check.

A proficient weaver can turn three spythronar webs into a rope of entanglement or 10 webs into leather armor of lightning resistance. Doing either requires other materials worth 500 gp, 5 days of work, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Spythronar swarms can weave dangerous webbing, making egg sacs quickly. It takes them some time to weave a sentient web.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** The sentient spythronar webs adhere to you if you touch them, and they charge their silken strands with lightning. Crushing spythronar egg sacs sets off a lightning discharge, but hitting them with lightning releases a new spythronar swarm.

## Traits

***Furtive.*** The spythronar swarm can use a bonus action to take the Hide action.

***Spider Climb.*** The spythronar swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Swarm.*** The spythronar swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny arachnid. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spythronar swarm knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spythronar swarm ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 10 (`4d4`) piercing damage and 9 (`2d8`) lightning damage, or 5 (`2d4`) piercing damage and 4 (`1d8`) lightning damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

***Weave (4/Day).*** The spythronar swarm weaves webbing, covering a 5-foot square. The swarm can then give up 1 hit point to create a spythronar sac in that space. If the swarm's webbing covers a 10-foot square, it can give up 23 hit points as part of the same action, creating a spythronar web with the same number of hit points. The swarm can't drop to 0 hit points to create a sac or web.

If the swarm weaves an incomplete web, that web is a normal web rather than a sentient, monstrous one. A creature that enters this normal web's space must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or become [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 10) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) while [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way. Each 5-foot square of this web has AC 10; the damage vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances of a spythronar web; and 5 hit points.
