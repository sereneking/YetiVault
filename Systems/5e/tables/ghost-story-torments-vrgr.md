| dice: d8 | Torment |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The Darklord tames the spirits in his haunted mansion, but only when he sacrifices a memory. |
| 2 | The Darklord's skin is haunted, but she can temporarily release spirits from her elaborate scars. |
| 3 | A dozen phantoms cater to the Darklord; each spirit is an emotion he can no longer feel. |
| 4 | Vampiric spirits keep the Darklord forever young, but physical sensation fled them long ago. |
| 5 | Despite being alive, the Darklord is cursed with the inability to convince anyone they're not a spirit. |
| 6 | All spirits obey a Darklord who can't touch anyone without stealing their soul. |
| 7 | The Darklord fully controls the veil between this world and the spirit world, but if he steps outside his mansion, he'll be permanently destroyed. |
| 8 | Any animal the Darklord sees dies and comes to haunt the morbid zoo her home has become. |
