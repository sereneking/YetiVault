# Ambush Prey
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, a broken twig
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You channel primal predatory energies to perfectly conceal your presence in order to surprise your target. You become [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) for the spell's duration, granting advantage on all Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to remain hidden. The invisibility will last for the duration of the spell, however, moving 5 feet or more from your position when you cast the spell will end the effect.

As long as you remain invisible, the first attack you make against any target who is unaware of your presence deals an additional `1d6` points of damage. This attack ends the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot above 2nd level, the damage of your first attack increases by `1d6` for every slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md)
