| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I prefer to parley before combat. If villains can be reformed without violence, all the better. |
| 2 | Shorter-lived species often have difficulty perceiving the full scope of time's tapestry and lack the patience for my appropriately thorough explanations. |
| 3 | Others might find me cold and dispassionate, but such is the price of perspective. Few creatures enjoy confronting the relative smallness of their lives. |
| 4 | Disguises allow me to bestow small kindnesses and experience the simple pleasures of companionship without constantly being petitioned. I'm proud of my acting ability and never break character. |
| 5 | The future is writ large in the patterns of history. I enjoy conversing with others who think critically about history and society. |
| 6 | I enjoy gifts but find attempts to hire or bribe me deeply offensive. |
| 7 | My reclusiveness is a filter. If someone lacks the motivation to overcome my barriers, then their matter is unworthy of my attention. |
| 8 | On a long enough timescale, all actions are meaningless. So why should I deny myself anything? |
