# Ise (Frost Rune)
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Ranger, and Rogue p. 1*  

This rune's magic evokes a frost giant's stoic calm. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Wisdom ([Animal Handling](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling)) checks and Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks.

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to increase your Strength score by 2 for 10 minutes. This increase can cause your score to exceed 20, but not 30. Once you invoke the rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
