# Survival Mantle
*Medium Armor, unknown*  

- **Armor Class**: 15 + DEX (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs.

This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor.

A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a [cloudkill](/Systems/5e/spells/cloudkill.md) spell, a [stinking cloud](/Systems/5e/spells/stinking-cloud.md) spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).
