| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | When a buyer stiffs the Stolen Glance, Zephesta hires the characters to collect the debt and "rough him up a little bit." She fails to mention the buyer is a [cloud giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/cloud-giant.md). |
| 2 | A [death tyrant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/death-tyrant.md) claiming to be the deceased founder of the Xanathar's Guild on Toril hires the party to obtain an invitation to the Family on its behalfâ€”or be destroyed. |
| 3 | The "Bank of Abbathor" hires the characters as security. The very same day, two [maelephants](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/maelephant-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") attempt to rob the bank. |
| 4 | [Doppelgangers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/doppelganger.md) in the Lookalikes gang take on the characters' appearances and go on a crime spree, creating problems for the party at multiple locations. |
