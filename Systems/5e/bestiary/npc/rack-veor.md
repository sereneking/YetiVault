## Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** Crunch has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Crunch's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Crunch makes three Armblade or Bolt Launcher attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a use of Snare Trap.

***Armblade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Bolt Launcher.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) piercing damage.

***Snare Trap (1/Day).*** Crunch deploys a Tiny mechanical trap on a solid surface within 5 feet of itself. The trap is hidden, requiring a successful DC 17 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to find. The trap lasts for 1 minute. Whenever an enemy enters a space within 10 feet of the trap or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (`6d6`) piercing damage and have the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. A creature makes this saving throw only once per turn.

## Bonus Actions

***Dash.*** Crunch moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
