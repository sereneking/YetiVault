# Claw of Acamar
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade, "The Great Old One" Patron

You can create a black, lead flail using your Pact of the Blade feature. The flail's head is sculpted to resemble a pair of grasping tentacles. The weapon has the reach property. When you hit a creature with it, you can expend a spell slot to deal an additional `2d8` necrotic damage to the target per spell level, and you can reduce the creature's speed to 0 feet until the end of your next turn.
