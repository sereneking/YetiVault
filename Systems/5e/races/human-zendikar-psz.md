## Traits

### Age

Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

### Size

Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: vampire curses, Elvish musical expressions, merfolk scholarly jargon, and so on.

## Description

Humans are the most numerous, diverse, and adaptable folk of Zendikar, and they form the core of most exploratory and adventurous expeditions across the plane. Though many humans huddle behind stone walls and wooden ramparts, at least somewhat protected from the perils of Zendikar, a significant number venture out from the safety of those walls to explore and defend their world. As the Eldrazi spread, more and more humans are driven out of their refuges and forced to confront the harsh reality of that alien threat.

### Life on the Frontiers

Most human communities on Zendikar are tiny villages, remote outposts, or temporary encampments. These settlements are found on every continent, from the coastal villages of Guul Draz to the giant caravan of Goma Fada on Akoum. Without the safety of walls and ramparts, frontier life is all about the struggle for survival, leaving little time or energy for scholarly pursuits. The people of most of these communities rely on hunting, gathering, herding, and trading for the food and other goods they need. Some, however, survive by preying on the people of other communities and caravans.

### Civilized Humanity

Despite the harshness of life on Zendikar, human civilization flourishes in a few scattered towns. Sea Gate (on the continent of Tazeem), Affa Town (on Akoum), and the so-called Free City of Nimana (in Guul Draz) are the most notable of these, boasting organized military forces, institutions of learning, established traditions of magic, houses of worship, and dark underbellies of crime and corruption. With populations measured in the thousands, these settlements would barely qualify as towns on other planes, but they have no rivals on Zendikar except the vampire city of Malakirâ€”which has been in ruins since the emergence of the Eldrazi.

#### The Expeditionary Houses

In Sea Gate, five so-called expeditionary houses launch regular excursions into the wilds for various purposes. Named for the destinations of their first expeditions, they are the Valakut House, the Pelakka Foundation, and the Akoum, Murasa, and Bala Ged Expeditionary Houses. The rivalries among the houses are legendary, and they are known to sabotage each other's expeditions. Each maintains hostels in various settlements, which serve as resources for adventurers and explorers who need to hire guides or purchase supplies.
