# Acererak
*Source: Tomb of Annihilation p. 209*  

Acererak is an archlich who travels between worlds and is known to take sick pleasure in devouring the souls of adventurers, whom he lures into trap-ridden dungeons where they suffer horrible deaths. One such dungeon lies under the lost city of Omu. This dungeon is called the Tomb of the Nine Gods, for Acererak slew nine false gods and sealed them within it. More recently, he built a necromantic device called the Soulmonger, then hid it in the heart of the tomb.

## Acererak's Traits

### Ideal

"Why be a god when I can be a creator of gods?"

### Bond

"I build dungeons to trap and slay powerful adventurers. Their deaths and souls are my nourishment."

### Flaw

"I underestimate the resolve of my enemies."

## Actions

***Paralyzing Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (`3d6`) cold damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute.

***Staff (+3 Quarterstaff).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage, or 8 (`1d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage when used with two hands.

***Invoke Curse.*** While holding the Staff of the Forgotten One, Acererak expends 1 charge from it and targets one creature he can see within 60 feet of him. The target must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or be cursed. Until the curse is ended, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. [Greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md), [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md), or similar magic ends the curse on the target.

The [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target its immune to Acererak's gaze for the next 24 hours.
