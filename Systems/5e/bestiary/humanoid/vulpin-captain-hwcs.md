# Vulpin Captain
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 207*  

Captains are respected among the bandit forces, leading units on raids and ambushes, and sometimes running the operations of an entire camp. While captains are among the more skilled warriors in the coalition, involvement with day-to-day operations grants them a certain rapport with even the low-ranking bandits. This leadership, coupled with their prowess, allows them to rally or kowtow those foolish enough to consider desertion. Vulpins, with their natural ambition, cunning, and force of personality, can readily be found climbing to the rank of captain.
