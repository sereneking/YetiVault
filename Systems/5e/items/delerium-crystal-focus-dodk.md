# Delerium Crystal Focus
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


This focus is made from a refined delerium crystal encased in a glass orb. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your spells. In addition, you can use the crystal as a spellcasting focus.

Once per day when you cast a spell of 5th level or lower, you may draw on the energy stored within the crystal to do so without expending a spell slot. If you do, you trigger a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim).
