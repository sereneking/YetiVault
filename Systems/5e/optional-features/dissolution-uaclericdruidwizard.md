# Dissolution
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Cleric, Druid, and Wizard p. 5*  

The first time the named creature takes damage from the spell, that creature takes an extra `2d8` force damage. The extra force damage increases by `1d8` when you reach 10th level (`3d8`) and 14th level (`4d8`) in this class.
