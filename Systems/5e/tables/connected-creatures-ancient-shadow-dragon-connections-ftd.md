| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A warlock hopes to make a pact with an ancient shadow dragon by way of an eldritch ritual. If the ritual succeeds, the dragon will be elevated to a status akin to that of a Great Old One. |
| 2 | An ancient shadow dragon is harried by a [solar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/solar.md). Once the two were friends, and the solar hopes to cleanse the shadow from the dragon. |
| 3 | Hidden away in an ancient shadow dragon's lair lurks a [demilich](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/demilich.md), its jeweled skull almost indistinguishable from the dragon's other grim baubles. |
| 4 | An ancient shadow dragon courts Tiamat, enacting the Dragon Queen's every demand in hopes of gaining her affectionâ€”and becoming her first shadow dragon consort. |
