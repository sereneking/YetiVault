| dice: d8 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A coven of [blood witches](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/blood-witch-ggr.md), seeking [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md)'s favor, uses magic to turn members of other guilds against their own allies. |
| 2 | Word spreads that a retiring performer wants to go out with a bang, and their final performance promises to be explosive. |
| 3 | Mocking the absence of the Guildpact, a [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md) troupe takes over the Chamber of the Guildpact and performs its satire before a captive audience. |
| 4 | A demon captures people and makes a game of thwarting their efforts to escape. |
| 5 | A skilled puppeteer uses skeletal marionettes to recreate historical acts of violence between guildsâ€”which are inexplicably repeated in the real world within the next few days. |
| 6 | A ringmaster has discovered magic that fills the whole audience with blood lust and sends them rampaging through the streets. |
| 7 | A hypnotist is programming audience members to go into a murderous rage when a triggering event occurs. |
| 8 | A crazed [blood witch](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/blood-witch-ggr.md) hopes to rouse [Rakdos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rakdos-ggr.md) by driving captured sacrificial victims into his lair. |
