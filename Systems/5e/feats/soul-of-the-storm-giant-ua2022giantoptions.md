# Soul of the Storm Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 8th-level

You've manifested divination abilities and tempest magic emblematic of storm giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Maelstrom Aura.** As a bonus action, you surround yourself in an aura of magical wind and lightning that extends 10 feet from you in every direction but not through total cover. The aura lasts for 1 minute or until you are [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). While the aura is active, attack rolls against you have disadvantage, and whenever a creature starts its turn within the sphere, you can force the creature's speed to be halved until the start of its next turn. Once you use this bonus action, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.  
- **Storm's Oracle.** You can cast the [divination](/Systems/5e/spells/divination.md) spell as a ritual, without needing material components. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat). Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.
