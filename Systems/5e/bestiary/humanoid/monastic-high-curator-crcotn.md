# Monastic High Curator
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 201*  

High curators collect knowledge and disseminate truth. They tackle puzzling mysteries and spy on members of other power structures to manipulate or destabilize them, and provide the oppressed with opportunities to escape their plight. High curators are privy to their organizations' deepest secrets and the activities of lesser agents. Their expertise enables them to manipulate energy to defend themselves and disrupt enemies' ability to act.

## Monastics of the Cobalt Soul

Scholars, priests, and ascetics who have been drawn to the cause of truth and knowledge spend their lives in support of the Library of the Cobalt Soul, united by the teachings of Ioun the Knowing Mentor. The Cobalt Soul is guided by a central belief that true strength comes from understanding the world around you. Beyond its efforts in knowledge-seeking, each branch of the Cobalt Soul strives to expose lies, unveil propaganda, and fight corruption in whatever society their chapter, referred to as an archive, calls home.

The Library of the Cobalt Soul is headquartered in Rexxentrum, the capital of the Dwendalian Empire on the continent of Wildemount. The organization has archives across Exandria. The Ank'Hareli branch of the Cobalt Soul is based in the Temple of the Mentor. Like many of the archives, the Temple of the Mentor is both a vast library and a shrine to Ioun. This Marquesian archive is led by High Curator Jamil A'alithiya.
