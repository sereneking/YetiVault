Demodands are primal creations of evil and implacable agents of destruction. Exiled to Carceri for their chaotic taint, they are also known as gehreleths or leths.

## Wardens of the Damned

Though they are trapped in Carceri, the demodands do not consider themselves prisoners. Instead, they are the self-appointed wardens and jailors of the Tarterian Depths. They derive pleasure from tormenting and terrorizing their fellow captives through acts of brutality, cruelly taunting them the entire time. However, they make no distinction between those actually condemned to Carceri, and planar travelers just passing through. As far as the demodand are concerned, all must be prevented from escaping at any cost.

## A Trio of the Grotesque

Demodands have three castes, each with a form so repulsive even other denizens of the Lower Planes view them with disgust. The farastu are forced to do the most menial tasks, under orders from their kelubar and shator superiors. When around weaker creatures they are vicious bullies; around more powerful beings they become whimpering cowards. The kelubars are the bureaucrats of the demodands, acting as intermediaries between the lowly farastu and their shator overlords. The kelubar decide which prisoners are rewarded, and which should be punished with extra torments. The shators make up the ruling caste, effectively serving as prison wardens to the lower-ranked guards.

## The Memory of Eons

Each shator possesses an obsidian triangle. These powerful magical artifacts grant the demodands access to the collective memory of their kind; a shared recollection stretching back to the very dawn of time. The shators primarily use the triangles to track the identity of every being that has ever escaped Carceri, concocting elaborate, generation-spanning strategies to recapture these fugitive souls.
