## Traits

***Might of the Master.*** The following numbers increase by 1 when your proficiency bonus increases by 1: the iron defender's skill bonuses, the bonuses to hit and damage of its bite, and the number of hit points restored by its Repair action.

***Vigilant.*** The iron defender can't be surprised.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. *Hit:* `1d8 + 2` piercing damage.

***Repair (3/Day).*** The magical mechanisms inside the iron defender restore `2d8 + 2` hit points to itself or to one construct or object within 5 feet of it.

## Reactions

***Defensive Pounce.*** The iron defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll of one creature it can see that is within 5 feet of it, provided the attack roll is against a creature other than the iron defender.
