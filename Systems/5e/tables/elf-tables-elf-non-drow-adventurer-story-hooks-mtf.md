| dice: d8 | Hook |
|----------|------|
| 1 | You believe the key to reuniting the elves with Corellon lies somewhere in the wider world, not within elven society, and you're determined to find it. |
| 2 | Your sibling was killed by a rampaging monster. You won't rest until you track it down and slay it. |
| 3 | A raven brought you a cryptic message from an old friend who needs your help, but the message was vague about the friend's location. You're trying to follow a years-old trail and save your friend. |
| 4 | A beautiful elf won your heart, then broke it. If you earn enough gold and glory by adventuring, perhaps you can win back your love. |
| 5 | Your father thought you too weak to survive as an adventurer, but he's wrong, and you'll prove it. |
| 6 | Only those who perform great deeds are remembered long after their death. Bards will honor your exploits for generations to come. |
| 7 | You're secretly in love with one of the other members of your adventuring group, and you can't bear the thought of any harm befalling that person. |
| 8 | When you were born, your grandmother prophesied you would one day rule a human kingdom. You've gone in search of that destiny. |
