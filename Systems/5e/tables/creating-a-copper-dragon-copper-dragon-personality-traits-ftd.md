| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I am generous with my time, my words, and my considerable wisdom—but my treasure is mine. |
| 2 | I love music. It is truly the universal language, able to express ideas far better than mere words alone. |
| 3 | I find the notion of trade and barter fascinating, and sometimes even find ways to participate in them. |
| 4 | There is no sound I love more than laughter, a powerful balm for hearts and minds. |
| 5 | I enjoy games of all kinds, especially challenges of wit and intellect—and those I can decisively win. |
| 6 | I admire how brightly short-lived creatures shine before their lights go out. |
| 7 | Nothing is more satisfying than deflating the egos of the high-and-mighty with a well-placed jibe. |
| 8 | When I'm bored, stirring up a settlement and watching its people scurry about amuses me. |
