# Ember of the Fire Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 8th-level

You've manifested the fiery combat emblematic of fire giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Born of Flame.** You have resistance to fire damage.  
- **Searing Ignition.** When you take the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can see you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to `2d6` + your proficiency bonus and is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the start of your next turn; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
