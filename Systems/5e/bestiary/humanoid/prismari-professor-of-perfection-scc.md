# Prismari Professor of Perfection
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 206*  

Professors of perfection combine elemental magic with precise, forceful physical motion. Their sweeping gestures and dance-like steps gather the power of crashing waves, conjure the protection of unyielding stone, and shape great structures of ice. Binding and channeling these natural elements allow the professors to mold their environment to their needs, both for breathtaking performances and to control the fabric of a battlefield against their foes.

These teachers stress attention to fine details, drilling their students on the most minuscule points. The perfect foundation ultimately leads to a flawless work of art, and the professors of perfection produce sculptural and architectural marvels.

## Prismari Scholars

The scholars of Prismari College believe that art is the truest form of spellcraft. They use magic to make splendid art, and they employ artistry to make their magic spectacular.
