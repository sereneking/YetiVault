# Hulking Crab
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 240*  

Much bigger than a giant crab, a hulking crab has a body 15 to 20 feet in diameter. Its shell is often covered with coral, anemones, ship wreckage, or some other sort of detritus salvaged from the ocean floor.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The crab can breathe air and water.

***Shell Camouflage.*** While the crab remains motionless with its eyestalks and pincers tucked close to its body, it resembles a natural formation or a pile of detritus. A creature within 30 feet of it can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The crab makes two attacks with its claws.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d10 + 4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15). The crab has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target
