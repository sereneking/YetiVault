# Pyremaul (Dormant)
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement)*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 B
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Heavy), Martial, [Two-handed](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed), [Vestige](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Vestige)

Forged from deep red iron, this massive hammer is set with a brilliant fire opal that shimmers with eternal flame. It is rumored to be currently wielded by "Grand Legate Phaestor, the fire giant ruler of Vulkanon", somewhere beneath the "Cliffkeep Mountains".

## Dormant

While Pyremaul is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra `1d6` fire damage.

Additionally, you can choose to have this weapon shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet (no action required).
