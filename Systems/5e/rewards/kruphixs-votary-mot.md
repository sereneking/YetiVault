# Kruphix's Votary
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 10+ Kruphix trait*

You can cast [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) with this trait, requiring no material components. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed).
