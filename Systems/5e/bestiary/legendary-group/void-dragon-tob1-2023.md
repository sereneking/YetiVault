# Void Dragon

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the dragon can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Orb of the Void.** The Void briefly overlaps the dragon's lair in a 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness punctuated by deep blue streaks and pinpoints of light. The sphere is centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of the dragon. The sphere spreads around corners, is heavily obscured, and contains no air (creatures must hold their breath). Each creature in the sphere when it appears must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any creature that ends its turn in the sphere takes 10 (`3d6`) cold damage. The sphere lasts until the dragon uses this lair action again or until the dragon dies.  
- **Spatial Anomaly.** The lair's connection to the Void briefly rips the fabric of space, forcing two creatures the dragon can see within 120 feet of it to suddenly exist at the same point in space and time. The laws of reality repel the creatures back to their original positions as reality resets. The targets aren't actually moved, but reality's reset forces each target to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 16 (`3d10`) force damage and is knocked prone. On a success, the creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.  
- **Zero Gravity.** Gravity stops working in a 50-foot radius, 100-foot-high cylinder centered on a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Each creature in that cylinder drifts 10 feet away from the ground and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A flying creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, but its speed is halved unless it can hover or flies magically. This effect lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a legendary Void dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Dark of the Void.** Nonmagical illumination, including sunlight, can't create bright light within 6 miles of the lair.  
- **Torn Veil.** Within 3 miles of the lair, disembodied voices whisper in the night. Celestials, Fey, and Fiends with a challenge rating of 2 or lower can choose to slip into the Material Plane from their native planes or vice versa.  
- **Uncovered Knowledge.** Secrets have a way of coming to light within 6 miles of the lair. Clues are inadvertently discovered, slips of the tongue hint at a hidden truth, and creatures become morbidly curious for forbidden knowledge.  

If the dragon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
