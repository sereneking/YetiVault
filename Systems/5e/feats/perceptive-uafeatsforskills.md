# Perceptive
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 3*  

You hone your senses until they become razor sharp. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- Being in a lightly obscured area doesn't impose disadvantage on your Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks if you can both see and hear.
