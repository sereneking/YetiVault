# Gaze of Khirad
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: 7th-level, "The Great Old One" Patron

You gain the piercing gaze of the blue star Khirad. As an action, you can see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet until the end of the current turn. During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.
