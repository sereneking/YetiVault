# Sand Silhouette
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 312*  

*A person made of sand emerges from the dune, a sandstorm of wailing souls swirling around it.*

Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells, or the victims of a dune collapse.

## Sand Bodies

If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.

## Traceless Movement

Sand silhouettes glide through the sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even cautious travelers with sudden attacks from below.

## Traits

***Sand Camouflage.*** The sand silhouette has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in desert terrain.

***Sand Form.*** The sand silhouette can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Sand Glide.*** The sand silhouette can burrow through nonmagical, loose sand without disturbing the material it is moving through.

***Undead Nature.*** The sand silhouette doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Water Hypersusceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the sand silhouette moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 2 (`1d4`) cold damage. In addition, the silhouette takes 10 cold damage when it starts its turn at least partially submerged in water.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sand silhouette makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit a Medium or smaller target, the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15), and the silhouette uses its Engulf on the target.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`3d6 + 4`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`1d6`) necrotic damage.

***Engulf.*** The sand silhouette engulfs a Medium or smaller creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by it. The engulfed target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of the sand silhouette's turns or take 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage. If the sand silhouette moves, the engulfed target moves with it. The sand silhouette can have only one creature engulfed at a time.

***Haunted Haboob (3/Day).*** The sand silhouette creates a storm of whirling sand and wailing souls around itself. The storm is a 10-foot radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder centered on the silhouette and moves with the silhouette for 1 minute, until it ends the storm as a bonus action, or until its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). The sandstorm's area is lightly obscured, and a creature that starts its turn in the sandstorm's area or enters it for the first time on a turn must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) necrotic damage and be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. An engulfed creature automatically succeeds on this saving throw. A [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
