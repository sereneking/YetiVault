## Traits

***Hold Breath.*** The ssurran can hold its breath for 15 minutes.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The ssurran makes two Claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) slashing damage.

***Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) poison damage.

***Poison Bomb.*** The ssurran throws a tangerine-sized bomb at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes, releasing a 10-foot-radius sphere of poisonous gas that disperses quickly. Each creature in the sphere must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. After the ssurran throws a bomb, roll a `d6`; on a roll of 4 or lower, the ssurran has no more bombs to throw.
