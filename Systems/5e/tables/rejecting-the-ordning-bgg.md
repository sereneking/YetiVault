`dice: [](rejecting-the-ordning-bgg.md#^rejecting-the-ordning)`

| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A giant wanders into a settlement of Humanoids looking for an opportunity to use talents the giant's kin do not value, but the giant is greeted with suspicion and hostility. The giant seeks adventurers to help negotiate peace with the settlement. |
| 2 | Characters must find a wise giant who has pursued specialized knowledge instead of excellence within the ordning. |
| 3 | A giant tries to use the characters as pawns in a scheme to subvert the ordning and increase the giant's status. |
| 4 | A charismatic leader gathers giants of different kinds into a mighty war band, intending to conquer and settle lands inhabited by Humanoids who seek adventurers' protection. |
| 5 | A [storm giant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/giant/storm-giant.md) asks adventurers to kill a revolutionary before the ordning is irrevocably disrupted. |
| 6 | A family of giants joined a cult of Elemental Evil and quickly took over the leadership, sorting its membership into a new hierarchy and creating dissension within the ranks—which the adventurers can use as they try to foil the cult's evil schemes. |
| 7 | A giant serving a demon lord attacks a town. The town's leaders ask the characters to retaliate against the giant's kin—which is exactly what the demon cultist was hoping for. |
| 8 | A group of giants seeks adventurers to deal with a surge of demon cult activity within the giants' community. |
