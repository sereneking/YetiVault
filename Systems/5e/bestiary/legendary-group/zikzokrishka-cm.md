# Zikzokrishka

## Lair actions
_Source: Candlekeep Mysteries_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) whenever she is in the are V3, Zikzokrishka can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. She can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Part of the ceiling collapses above one creature that Zikzokrishka can see. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (`6d6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) and buried under rubble. A buried creature is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and unable to stand up. A creature can use an action to try to pull itself or another creature out of the rubble, doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check.  
- A cloud of sand swirls in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point Zikzokrishka can see within 60 feet of it. The cloud spreads around corners. Each creature in the cloud must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- Zikzokrishka chooses two points that it can see, each of which must be on a solid surface, and creates a 5-foot-wide line of lightning between them. The two points must be within 60 feet of Zikzokrishka and 60 feet of each other. Each creature in the line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) lightning damage.
