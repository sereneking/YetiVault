## Traits

### Age

Like humans, aven reach adulthood in their late teens and can live into their 80s.

### Alignment

Aven are inclined toward the lawful good alignment of the Church of Serra

### Size

Aven stand from 5 to 6 feet tall, but their bodies are slender and their bones are partially hollow to facilitate their flight. Your size is Medium.

### Flight

You have a flying speed of 30 feet. You can't use your flying speed while you wear medium or heavy armor. (If your campaign uses the variant rule for [encumbrance](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/encumbrance.md), you can't use your flying speed if you are encumbered.) 

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Aven.

### Hawkeyed

You have proficiency in the [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception) skill. In addition, attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.

## Description

Following the devastation of the distant continent of Otaria in Karona's War some two and a half centuries ago, people of many races left that land to find refuge elsewhere. Among them were the birdlike people called aven, who were largely unknown outside of Otaria prior to their exodus. Rather than dispersing around the world and assimilating into local cultures, they wandered in great flocks, forming separate communities in a few hospitable locations. The largest such flock settled in Benalia, where its people submitted themselves to Benalish law in exchange for hospitality. The aven have no representation on the Council of Seven, but many hope to see that change.

Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, with wings and heads resembling those of eagles. Their lean forms are covered with feathers, and their arms and legs all end in sharp talons.

Aven form their own airborne companies, or wings, within the Benalish army. They serve as soldiers, battle priests, and occasionally heroes, but do not become knights except under truly exceptional circumstances. Worship of Serra is all but universal among the aven because of syncretistic fusion with their traditional religious beliefs, and many aven are Serran acolytes.
