# Research
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 11* 

Forewarned is forearmed. The research activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, location, magic item, or some other topic.

## Resources

Research requires one workweek of work and at least 100 gp spent on materials, bribes, gifts, and other expenses. Typically, a character needs access to a library or sage to conduct research.

## Resolution

The character declares the focus of the research—a specific person, place, or thing. After a workweek of research, a character makes an Intelligence check with a +1 bonus per 100 gp spent beyond the initial 100 gp, to a maximum of +6. In addition, a character with access to a particularly well-stocked library or knowledgeable sages gains advantage on this check. Determine how much lore a character learns using the Research table.

**Research**

| Check Total | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 1–5 | No effect. |
| 6–10 | You learn one piece of useful lore. |
| 11–20 | You learn two pieces of useful lore. |
| 21+ | You learn three pieces of useful lore. |

Each piece of useful lore is the equivalent of one true statement about a person, place, or thing. Examples include knowledge of a creature's resistances, the password needed to enter a sealed dungeon level, the spells commonly prepared by an order of wizards, and so on.

For a monster or an NPC, you can reveal elements of stats or personality. For a place, you can reveal secrets about it, such as a hidden entrance, the answer to a riddle, or the nature of a creature that guards the place.

You can also give out specific pieces of information with research, especially if the players want to know about a specific thing.

Alternatively, a player can track how many nonspecific pieces of lore have been accumulated by their character. At any time during play, the player can expend a piece of lore to learn about a monster, a place, a person, and so on; the character has a sudden insight or recalls the relevant information.

At one time, a character can have a number of unexpended nonspecific pieces of lore no higher than 1 + their Intelligence modifier (minimum of one piece of lore).

## Complications

The greatest danger in research is uncovering false information. Not all lore is truthful, and a foil with a scholarly bent might try to lead the characters astray, especially if the object of the research is known to the foil. The foil might plant false information, bribe sages to give bad advice, or steal key tomes needed to find the truth.

In addition, a character might run into other complications during research. If you want to introduce a complication, use the Research Complications table, or create an incident.
