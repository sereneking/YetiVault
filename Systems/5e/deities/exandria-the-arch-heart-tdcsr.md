Guardian of spring, beauty, and the arts, the Arch Heart is the patron of arcane magic, "elves", and the fey. The "Founding" inspired them to wander the twisted lands, seeding them with the first arcane magics and raising the most ancient of forests. It was by the Arch Heart's hand that the first "elves" wandered from the Fey Realm, and for this reason, they are considered the Parent of all "elves". Those who seek art in all of their work, whether magic or mundane, often worship at the altar of the Arch Heart. They loathe the Spider Queen and her priestesses for leading the drow astray.

## Depiction

Most modern tapestries and tomes depict the Arch Heart as a genderless elf of impossible grace and beauty, androgynous and alluring, framed by long, wavy, golden hair. The Arch Heart inspired many early elven art pieces, and elements of their visage or symbol are included in most elven architecture.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Arch Heart's clerics are granted powers of Arcana, Nature, or Light.

## Holy Day

The Arch Heart's holy day is called Elvendawn, or Midsummer. It's celebrated on the twentieth day of the sixth month, and commemorates the "elves'" first emergence from the Fey Realm. In "Syngorn", the "elves" build magical wards, open small doorways into the Fey Realm, and celebrate with uncharacteristic vigor with the wild fey.

- Create, inspire, and find beauty in all that you do.  
- Follow the echoes of lost magic, forgotten sites,and ancient art, for within these lie the ArchHeart's first works.  
- Combat the followers of the Spider Queen wherever they may be.
