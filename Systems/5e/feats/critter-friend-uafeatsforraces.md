# Critter Friend
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 1*  

**Prerequisite**: [Gnome (Forest)](/Systems/5e/races/gnome-forest.md)

Your friendship with animals mystically deepens. You gain the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Animal Handling](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- You learn the [speak with animals](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-animals.md) spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn the [animal friendship](/Systems/5e/spells/animal-friendship.md) spell, and you can cast it once with this feat, without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
