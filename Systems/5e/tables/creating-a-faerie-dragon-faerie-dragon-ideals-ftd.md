| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Benevolence. Jokes are one thing, but I won't abide cruelty. My mischief brings joy to the downtrodden and ridicule to oppressors. (Good) |
| 2 | Variety. How can anyone stand to do the same things over and over? I take any opportunity to shake things up by trying something new. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Fun. What's the point of living if you're not going to enjoy yourself? (Any) |
| 4 | Humor. My jokes make life more interesting for everyone. Or at least for me. (Any) |
| 5 | Energy. Boredom is worse than death. I'm not much for plans, but you can always count on me to make something happen! (Chaotic) |
| 6 | Selfishness. Other creatures exist for my amusement. If tormenting them were wrong, why would I enjoy it so much? (Evil) |
