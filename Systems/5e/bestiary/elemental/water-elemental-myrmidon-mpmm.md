## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The myrmidon makes three Trident attacks.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) force damage, or 8 (`1d8 + 4`) force damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Freezing Strikes (Recharge 6).*** The myrmidon uses Multiattack. Each attack that hits deals an extra 5 (`1d10`) cold damage. A target that is hit by one or more of these attacks has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of the myrmidon's next turn.
