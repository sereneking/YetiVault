| dice: d8 | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | While in the tower of Mordain the Fleshweaver, spill blood on the stairs between the third and fourth floors. |
| 2 | As you pursue a Cult of the Dragon Below into the caverns of Khyber, retrieve one (and only one) of a specific variety of mushroom from a cave where twelve crystals glow. |
| 3 | Ensure that the villain you are pursuing dies by falling from a great height, not by any other means. |
| 4 | Remove the obstacles that prevent a retired adventurer from marrying the nobleman she loves, so that their child can grow up to carry out another part of your patron's plan. |
| 5 | Plant a magical seed in a remote location to ensure it grows into a mighty tree and bears fruit that will give power to future heroes. |
| 6 | Defeat a dragon-blooded sorcerer who is doing the bidding of the Chamber—and wreaking havoc in Darguun in the process. |
| 7 | Destroy an eldritch machine, created by a rogue Cannith artificer, that is drawing on the energy of an imprisoned rakshasa—and that will, unknown to the inventor, lead to the rakshasa's release. |
| 8 | Protect a kalashtar monk who is being targeted by Dreaming Dark assassins as she studies a path that might eventually prevent the quori from projecting themselves into the Material Plane. |
