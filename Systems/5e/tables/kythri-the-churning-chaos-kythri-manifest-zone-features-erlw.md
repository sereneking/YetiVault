| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The earth here is highly changeable and unstable. A creature that succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check as an action can alter a 20-by-20-foot square of terrain in some way. For example, they might choose to turn the earth to mud, cause stony spikes to erupt from the soil, or warp local plant life. Failing the check causes random, uncontrolled effects. |
| 2 | Fabulous formations of precariously balancing rocks dot these badlands. They randomly collapse, only to slowly reassemble over the course of days. |
| 3 | Packs of slaadi erupt from inside a local cave networks at random intervals, terrorizing travelers. |
| 4 | Any spell that deals acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, or thunder damage cast within the zone instead deals one of those damage types determined at random. |
