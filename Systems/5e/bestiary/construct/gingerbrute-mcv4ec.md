# Gingerbrute
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Gingerbread cookies baked in the wilds of Eldraine—or made from ingredients grown there—have a habit of developing a life of their own. Known as gingerbrutes, these cookie Constructs are notoriously difficult to pin down.

When an unfortunate baker accidentally creates a gingerbrute, the cookie causes mayhem throughout the kitchen before running back to the wilds where its ingredients originated. Many witches of Dunbarrow craft gingerbrutes intentionally, whipping them into shape (sometimes with actual whipped cream) as soldiers to defend their wicked cauldrons.

The same magic that animates a gingerbrute also makes it extra scrumptious. Those who have eaten a gingerbrute report feeling a burst of energy like a long-lasting sugar rush.
