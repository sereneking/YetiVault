## Traits

***Unique Programming.*** Gearbox's unique programming allows the modron to function as an [Orb of Direction](/Systems/5e/items/orb-of-direction-xge.md) and an [Orb of Time](/Systems/5e/items/orb-of-time-xge.md), to cast the [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md) cantrip at will, and to grant other characters advantage on Dexterity checks made with thieves' tools and on ability checks made to identify or operate mechanical or laboratory equipment.

***Axiomatic Mind.*** Gearbox can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

***Disintegration.*** If Gearbox dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

***Spellcasting.*** Gearbox can cast the [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md) cantrip at will.

**Cantrips (at will)**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)
