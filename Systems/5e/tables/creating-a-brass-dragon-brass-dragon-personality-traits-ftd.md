| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I don't ask for much in a conversation partner—just smile, occasionally nod, and stay awake! |
| 2 | I'm skilled at making others feel that I'm interested in the details of their tiny, meaningless lives. |
| 3 | Every word I say is worth hearing, so I speak loudly and eloquently to make sure I get my point across. |
| 4 | I don't care about the opinions of creatures that are less intelligent than I am. But I'm fascinated by creatures that are significantly more intelligent. |
| 5 | Hoarding knowledge is no fun. It's best when you can trade knowledge away for treasure. |
| 6 | I'm fascinated by intelligence with no brain—talking swords, sapient Constructs, and the like. |
| 7 | I love hearing stories and songs and sharing them with others to bring comfort and calm. |
| 8 | I have no patience for people who imagine their lives are the least bit important. |
