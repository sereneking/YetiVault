# Hadozee Warrior
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 29*  

Hadozee warriors make their living as mercenaries, sometimes in the company of pirates. Squads of warriors often adopt colorful names, such as the Soaring Hadozees, the Jammin' Wingbats, and the Night Howlers.

## Traits

***Glide.*** If it isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) or wearing heavy armor, the hadozee can extend its skin membranes to move up to 5 feet horizontally for every 1 foot it descends in the air.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hadozee makes two Shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Safe Descent.*** When it would take damage from a fall, the hadozee extends its skin membranes to reduce the fall's damage to 0, provided it isn't wearing heavy armor.

***Uncanny Dodge.*** The hadozee halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it, provided it can see the attacker.
