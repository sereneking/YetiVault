# Summon Undead Spirit
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a gilded humanoid skull worth at least 300 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a restless spirit from beyond the grave. The spirit manifests physically in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This corporeal form uses the Undead Spirit stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The creature physically resembles a humanoid with the chosen form, which also determines some of the traits in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions for the spell's duration. In combat, the creature shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it defends itself but otherwise takes no action.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the creature assumes the higher level for that casting wherever it uses the spell's level in its stat block.

**Classes**: [Warlock](/Systems/5e/classes/warlock.md), [Wizard](/Systems/5e/classes/wizard.md)
