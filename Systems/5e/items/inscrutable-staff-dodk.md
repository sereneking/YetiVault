# Inscrutable Staff
*Melee Weapon, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and your spell save DC.

The staff has 20 charges, and regains `2d10` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the staff triggers a random arcane anomaly (see Dungeons of Drakkenheim). On a 20, the staff regains `1d10` charges.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: [haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) (3 charges), [slow](/Systems/5e/spells/slow.md) (3 charges), [arcane eye](/Systems/5e/spells/arcane-eye.md) (4 charges), [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md) (4 charges), [Bigby's hand](/Systems/5e/spells/bigbys-hand.md) (5 charges), [wall of force](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-force.md) (5 charges), [disintegrate](/Systems/5e/spells/disintegrate.md) (6 charges), [reverse gravity](/Systems/5e/spells/reverse-gravity.md) (7 charges), or [maze](/Systems/5e/spells/maze.md) (8 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [Tenser's Floating Disk](/Systems/5e/spells/tensers-floating-disk.md), [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md), [mending](/Systems/5e/spells/mending.md), [message](/Systems/5e/spells/message.md), or [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md).

## Crown Authority

A character cannot attune to more than one Seal of Drakkenheim. Guardian constructs in Drakkenheim such as [wall gargoyles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) and [tower dragons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) do not attack you while you are attuned to one of the Seals of Drakkenheim. An individual guardian ignores this effect for 24 hours if you attack it or cast a spell upon it.

As an action, you may present a Seal of Drakkenheim to rebuke the guardians. You make an opposed Charisma ability check against each [wall gargoyle](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/wall-gargoyle-dodk.md) or [tower dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/tower-dragon-dodk.md) that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you. If you win the contest, the creature is rebuked for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. A rebuked creature doesn't move, and can't take actions or reactions. A creature who wins the contest is immune to your rebuke for 24 hours.
