# Robot Controller
*Adventuring Gear*  


This small handheld device features a glass pane with a glowing display that responds to your touch.

The controller is powered by an [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) stored in the device. Placing a full [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) in the device gives the device 3 charges.

As an action while holding this device, you can expend 1 of its charges to cause one of the following effects:

## Control

One Construct of your choice within 60 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the Construct obeys your verbal commands, and you and the Construct can communicate remotely with each other through the device. Whenever the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) Construct takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Disrupt

Constructs of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition for 1 minute. An [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) Construct can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Replacing the Energy Cell

While the device has charges remaining, its [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) can't be removed. Once the device has 0 charges, you can replace the [energy cell](/Systems/5e/items/energy-cell.md) with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.
