# Ring of Treachery
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  


This ring has 3 charges. While wearing this ring, when you're damaged, you may use a reaction to expend a charge and transfer that damage to a random creature (which could include an ally) within 60 feet. All charges are restored when you finish a long rest.
