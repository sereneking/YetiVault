# Vigor Of The Hill Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Wonders of the Multivers p. 10*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the resilience emblematic of hill giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Bulwark.** When you are subjected to an effect that would move you at least 5 feet or knock you [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), you can use your reaction to steady yourself. You are then neither moved nor knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- **Iron Stomach.** Whenever you eat food as part of a short rest and spend one or more Hit Dice to regain hit points, you regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.
