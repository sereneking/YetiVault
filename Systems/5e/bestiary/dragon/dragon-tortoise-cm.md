# Dragon Tortoise
*Source: Candlekeep Mysteries p. 205*  

Ogruhl has been trapped here for millennia, restrained by magic chains. Ogruhl was the prisoner of a cruel Netherese wizard. When the city around the tortoise was abandoned, Ogruhl was left to die. A band of chwingas found the tortoise and brought it food and water little by little to keep it alive. Over time, the chwingas and Ogruhl developed a symbiotic relationship—it defended them and provided a home for them, and they helped it to survive.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon turtle makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. It can make one tail attack in place of its two claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (`3d12 + 7`) piercing damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d8 + 7`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (`3d12 + 7`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away from the dragon turtle and knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Sand Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon tortoise exhales abrasive sand in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (`15d6`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
