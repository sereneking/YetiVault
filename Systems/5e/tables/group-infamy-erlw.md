**Group Infamy**

`dice: [](group-infamy-erlw.md#^group-infamy)`

| dice: d6 | Notorious Element |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Tattoos**. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work. |
| 2 | **Outfit**. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory. |
| 3 | **Infamy**. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town. |
| 4 | **Idols**. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair. |
| 5 | **Legitimate**. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder. |
| 6 | **Legends**. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way. |
