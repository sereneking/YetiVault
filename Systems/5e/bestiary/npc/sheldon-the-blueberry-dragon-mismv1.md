# Sheldon the Blueberry Dragon
*Source: Misplaced Monsters: Volume 1 p. 14*  

> [!note]
> Created by Samuel B.

Sheldon is a friendly, good-natured dragon who collects and eats blueberries. When he's not attending parties, he lives in Wildspace. His body magically produces air, allowing him to thrive in a vacuum and create powerful gusts of wind. Sheldon uses the wind to knock down foes and propel himself farther than his wings can take him on their own.

## Traits

***Space Dweller.*** Sheldon can breathe normally in a vacuum.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** Sheldon casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 14):

**At will**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible)

**1/day each**: [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [telekinesis](/Systems/5e/spells/telekinesis.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Sheldon makes either two Bite attacks, two Blueberry Fling attacks, or one of each.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) psychic damage.

***Blueberry Fling.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) blueberry damage.

***Jetstream Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** Sheldon exhales a line of magical wind that is 60 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 21 (`6d6`) force damage, is pushed 15 feet away from Sheldon, and has the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## Bonus Actions

***Wind Dash (2/Day).*** Sheldon summons a powerful gust of wind and flies up to his speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. At the end of this movement, each creature within 5 feet of Sheldon must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition, as the wind bursts around Sheldon.
