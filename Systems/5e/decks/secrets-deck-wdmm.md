# Secrets Deck
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 319*  

Appendix C of this book contains the [Secrets Deck](/Systems/5e/decks/secrets-deck-wdmm.md)—paper cards for you to photocopy and hand out to the players when their characters learn reliable information about Halaster and Undermountain.

Any character who spends at least four hours in the Yawning Portal is likely to overhear tall tales about the Mad Mage and his dungeon. Not all rumors are to be believed, however, and characters need keen ears and sharp insight to determine which stories have weight. Have each character make a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check or Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check. If the check succeeds, the character learns a secret about Undermountain, and the player can draw a card from the [Secrets Deck](/Systems/5e/decks/secrets-deck-wdmm.md).

Players can hold onto these cards for later reference. When the characters meet an NPC in Undermountain who knows a fact, have one of the players draw another card from the [Secrets Deck](/Systems/5e/decks/secrets-deck-wdmm.md) to determine what that NPC knows about Halaster and his dungeon.

## Cards

### Guild of Many Eyes
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/GuildofManyEyes.webp#card)
A thieves' guild that was driven from Waterdeep long ago still lurks in Undermountain, waiting and scheming to win back power in the city above. These villains make the sewers unsafe for honest folk to venture into. They have recently taken over Skullport, a subterranean town connected to Undermountain.

### Immortal Insanity
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/ImmortalInsanity.webp#card)
The Mad Mage of Undermountain has destroyed himself or been destroyed many times, but his demise is always short-lived. Folk say the dungeon cannot exist without him, and so it magically re-creates the archmage whenever he meets his end within its crumbling halls. Each time Halaster returns, less of his sanity remains.

### Skullport
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/Skullport.webp#card)
Skullport overlooks the Sargauth River, a watery thoroughfare that cuts through the third level of Undermountain. Pirates once used the subterranean settlement as a trade port, but now it's a monster-infested haunt where spies and assassins hone their craft. Beware the fortress overlooking the river! Its garrison is commanded by an evil knight with a wyvern mount.

### Tangled Web
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/TangledWeb.webp#card)
Secret temples exist in great numbers in Undermountain, particularly those of evil gods not welcomed in the city above. The vile servants of these deities are locked in an endless war for supremacy in the dark dungeon. Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders, is the fiendish mastermind behind many of these bloody conflicts.

### Arcturiadoom
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/Arcturiadoom.webp#card)
One of Halaster's apprentices was a human transmuter named Arcturia, who created all manner of new monsters and often made herself the subject of her own horrid magical transformations. She claimed an entire level of Undermountain as her lair and polymorphed prisoners into monsters to guard it. It's likely that Arcturia resides in Undermountain still, in one form or another.

### What Drow Fear
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/WhatDrowFear.webp#card)
Part of Undermountain was carved out by the drow. Muiral, said to be a former bodyguard and apprentice of Halaster's, claims this domain and hunts trespass- ers for sport. These halls are littered with the bones of the slaughtered. Even the dark elves speak of Muiral in hushed tones. Anyone who can terrify the drow should be avoided at all costs.

### Dwarfcraft
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/Dwarfcraft.webp#card)
Much of Undermountain was built long ago by the shield dwarves of the Melairkyn clan. These dwarves were masters of stonework and hid many of their rooms behind secret doors. They also dug deep in search of precious metals. These mines were later stripped by duergar invaders, leaving a maze of worthless tunnels and cav- erns for monsters to inhabit.

### School of Magic
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/SchoolOfMagic.webp#card)
Rumor has it that a wizards' academy has opened on one of Undermountain's levels. It's not known who runs this academy—perhaps one of Halaster's apprentices or the Mad Mage himself—but many mages have been drawn down to it. What wizard wouldn't want to glimpse the powerful magic gathering dust in the depths of Undermountain?

### Mad House
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/MadHouse.webp#card)
The Shadowdusks were a Waterdavian noble family whose quest for political supremacy ended centuries ago after Shadowdusk wizards opened portals to the Far Realm. Twisted by madness and driven from their home, they sought assistance from Halaster and sank into the depths of Undermountain, never to be seen again—yet vestiges of the noble house undoubtedly remain.

### Underground Forest
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/UndergroundForest.webp#card)
The River of the Depths connects the fourth and fifth levels of Undermountain, skirting the edges of vast caverns filled with trees, shrubs, birds, other animals, and sunlight. An entire forest, as real as any found on the surface, waits to be explored, but an archdruid protects it. And explorers traveling downriver have seen a huge green dragon as well, perched on a tower near a bridge that spans the river.

### Scavenger
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/Scavenger.webp#card)
The Sea of Swords has borne its share of pirate ships, none stranger than the *Scavenger*. This vessel could travel below the waves and through the air. No one has seen it in years. Perhaps it sank or was lost in the starry maelstrom of the night sky, but divination spells suggest it found its way into Undermountain. Others have searched for it below Waterdeep, but no one has found it and lived to tell the tale.

### Trobriand's Army
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/TrobriandsArmy.webp#card)
Trobriand was one of Halaster's most promising and demented apprentices. Fascinated by machines, he carved out a level of the Mad Mage's dungeon for himself and set to work building an army of constructs there. It is said that Trobriand controls his creations with a metal ring, and that he crafted similar rings of lesser power for his apprentices, to protect them in the event that his constructs went insane.

### Death Tyrant
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/DeathTyrant.webp#card)
The Mad Mage has transformed an entire level of Undermountain into a proving ground for adventurers who seek to reach the deepest layers of the dungeon and the treasures hidden within. At the end of this underground obstacle course waits the greatest challenge of all: Netherskull the Death Tyrant, an undead beholder that hates wizards above all.

### Nester's Fate
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/NestersFate.webp#card)
Halaster brought seven apprentices with him to Undermountain. One of them, Nester, became a lich using spells and methods of his own devising. But his process was flawed, and over time Nester's phylactery and body disintegrated until only his floating skull and skeletal arms remained. Driven mad by his failure to achieve true lichdom, Nester continues to haunt Undermountain in this weakened form.

### Dark Elf Menace
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/DarkElfMenace.webp#card)
Recent conflicts in Menzoberranzan have left weakened drow houses fearing for their future. Drow are coming to Undermountain in droves to carve out sanctuaries for one house or another. Halaster can't be happy to see them return in force, but who knows? Maybe the Mad Mage orchestrated the upheaval to bring the dark elves scurrying back for reasons beyond the comprehension of the sane.

### Emerald Blade
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/EmeraldBlade.webp#card)
Waterdeep was erected atop the bones of a dwarven kingdom built on the dust of a much older elven kingdom. It is said that a relic of the elves still waits to be found in Undermountain: a magic sword so sharp that its edge can slice through stone. Many adventurers have vanished during their hunt for the weapon, which, it is said, the elves blessed with the heart of a warrior and the soul of a poet.

### Gith Who's Coming to Dinner?
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/GithWhosComingToDinner.webp#card)
Githyanki have invaded Undermountain. Perhaps they seek to destroy a mind flayer colony hidden in the depths of the dungeon, or perhaps they are planning to attack and plunder Waterdeep. There's one other possibility: the githyanki might be building a creche—a stronghold away from the timeless Astral Plane where they can raise their young and train them in the art of war.

### Spire and Snail
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/5etools-mirror-2/5etools-img/main/decks/WDMM/Secrets/SpireandSnail.webp#card)
Deep within Undermountain is a vast cavern containing a giant stalagmite that has been hollowed out to serve as a wizard's tower, perhaps even a refuge for the Mad Mage himself. The tower is guarded by stone constructs. No one knows what dwells inside. Not far from this tower lurks a most peculiar creature: a giant snail with a shell of pure gold.
