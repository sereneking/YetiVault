# Malformed Kraken
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 239*  

The Doomvault (Dead in Thay) contains a number of denizens that don't have all the traits or abilities of normal creatures of their kind. By far the most powerful of these "inferior" creatures is a malformed kraken that is kept in a saltwater pool and is not as large or as durable as a true kraken

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The kraken can breathe air and water.

***Siege Monster.*** The kraken deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The kraken makes three tentacle attacks. One of them can be replaced with a bite attack, and any of them can be replaced with Fling.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d8 + 7`) piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d6 + 7`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). The kraken has ten tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

***Fling.*** One Medium or smaller object held or creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the kraken's tentacles is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (`1d6`) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Lightning Storm.*** The kraken creates three bolts of lightning, each of which can strike a target the kraken can see within 150 feet of it. A target must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (`3d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
