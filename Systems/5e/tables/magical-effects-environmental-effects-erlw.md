**Environmental Effects**

`dice: [](magical-effects-environmental-effects-erlw.md#^environmental-effects)`

| dice: d8 | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Healing spells are impeded here. Any spell that restores hit points does so as if it were cast at a level one lower than the spell slot expended. A spell cast using a 1st-level slot restores no hit points. |
| 2 | A character who casts a spell must make a Constitution saving throw against the character's own spell save DC. On a failed save, the character takes psychic damage equal to the spell's level and gains one level of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion). |
| 3 | Any Medium humanoid that dies in the area reanimates as a [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) at the start of its next turn. The zombie is under the DM's control. |
| 4 | The area is affected by a [silence](/Systems/5e/spells/silence.md) spell. |
| 5 | Each creature that enters the area is affected by an [enlarge/reduce](/Systems/5e/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell, with an equal chance for each effect. The effect lasts until the creature leaves the area. |
| 6 | The pull of gravity is lessened. Creatures can jump twice the normal distance in any direction, and everything effectively weighs half its actual weight. |
| 7 | All creatures are linked to every other creature in the area as if by the [telepathy](/Systems/5e/spells/telepathy.md) spell. |
| 8 | A creature that casts a spell of 1st level or higher in the area rolls on the [Wild Magic Surge](/Systems/5e/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in chapter 3 of the "Player's Handbook". |
