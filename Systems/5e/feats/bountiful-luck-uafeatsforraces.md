# Bountiful Luck
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 1*  

**Prerequisite**: [Halfling](/Systems/5e/races/halfling.md)

Whenever an ally you can see within 30 feet of you rolls a 1 on the `d20` for an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to let the ally reroll the die. The ally must use the new roll.
