# Witchkite
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

While many dragons of Eldraine hoard wealth and material goods, witchkites prefer hoarding forbidden and dangerous magical secrets. The arcane nature of a witchkite's hoard seeps into the dragon's core, granting it spellcasting abilities and twisting its fiery breath into malevolent motes of magical flame.

On Magic cards, there are red dragons (Opportunistic Dragon (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=532521), Decadent Dragon (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=629724), and Realm-Scorcher Hellkite (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=629646)), bronze dragons (Loch Dragon (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=473173)), and moonstone dragons (Shimmer Dragon (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=612484) and Archive Dragon (https://gatherer.wizards.com/pages/card/details.aspx?multiverseid=629542)).

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the witchkite fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Spellcasting.*** The witchkite casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md), [speak with dead](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-dead.md)

**1/day each**: [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [dimension door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [hold monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The witchkite makes two Rend attacks and uses Malevolent Flare once.

***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`3d6 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Malevolent Flare.*** The witchkite spits magical, green-tinged flame at one creature it can see within 60 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (`5d8`) fire damage and suffers one of the following effects of the witchkite's choice:

- The target must use its reaction to make a melee attack against another creature of the witchkite's choice that is within the target's reach.  
- The target takes 13 (`2d12`) psychic damage.  

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.

## Reactions

The witchkite can take up to two reactions per round but only one per turn.

***Enchanting Gaze.*** When a creature the witchkite can see moves within 10 feet of it, the witchkite emits an enchanting gaze at the creature. The creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) psychic damage and have the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition until the end of its next turn.

***Retribution.*** Immediately after taking damage from a melee attack, the witchkite makes one Rend attack against the attacker.
