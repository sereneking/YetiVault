# Cloak of Baalzebul
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Fiend" Patron

As a bonus action, you can conjure a swarm of buzzing flies around you. The swarm grants you advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. In addition, a creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of you takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier. You can dismiss the swarm with another bonus action.
