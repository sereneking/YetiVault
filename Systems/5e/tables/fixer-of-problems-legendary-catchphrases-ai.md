| 1 | Looks like this is the end. So let's go back to the beginning. |
| 2 | There's only one way out of this pickle, and that's by breaking a few jars! |
| 3 | Looks like trouble has some vacation time coming up. So let's book it a nice inn. |
| 4 | We've got a real game of cat and mouse here... so it's time to eat some cheese. |
| 5 | Is that all I've got?! |
| 6 | It's always darkest before the dawn, except when the moon is full. So let's moon! |
| 7 | We might be beaten, but we're not beaten! Because "beaten" means different things in both those contexts! |
