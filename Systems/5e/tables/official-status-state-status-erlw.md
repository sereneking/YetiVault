**State Status**

`dice: [](official-status-state-status-erlw.md#^state-status)`

| dice: d6 | Status |
|----------|--------|
| 1–3 | **Official**. You hold an official position and are recognized as attached to your patron. You can expect the head of state's support, but you must also ensure your actions avoid staining your patron's reputation. |
| 4–5 | **Shadow**. You can expect no official, public recognition of your work, but the head of state you work for does acknowledge you in private and provide help. |
| 6 | **Double**. Your allegiance lies with an official or government other than the one you overtly serve. You may receive support from the head of state you openly answer follow, as well as the official you secretly report to, but must remain on constant guard against having your true loyalties revealed. |
