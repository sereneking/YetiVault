**Sigil Undersigil Encounters**

`dice: [](sigil-undersigil-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-undersigil-encounters)`

| dice: d6 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [vargouille reflection](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/vargouille-reflection-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") sprouts from a nearby corpse. |
| 2 | Putrice, a [night hag](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/night-hag.md), cackles as she fishes a wriggling [larva](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/larva-dmg.md) (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") from a vent underneath a fiend-owned restaurant. |
| 3 | Two [cranium rat squeakers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/cranium-rat-squeaker-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") gnaw on the bones of a [skeleton](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md), which reaches out toward the characters for help. |
| 4 | Two [dabus](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/dabus-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") prune back a mass of razorvine that has spread through a barred grate to the busy street above. As they trim its barbed branches, something shudders within. |
| 5 | Three [sahuagin](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/sahuagin.md) emerge from a wide pipe. "Polluters!" shouts one of them, addressing the characters. |
| 6 | A warm sponge cake cools on a dusty stone ledge. Its sweet, strawberry aroma wafts through the otherwise dingy passage. A note reading "DO NOT EAT" rests below its porcelain serving dish. |
