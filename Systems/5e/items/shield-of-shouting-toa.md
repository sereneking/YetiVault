# Shield of Shouting
*Shield, unknown (magic)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) spell reveals an aura of transmutation magic around this shield, which has a minor magical property: words spoken by the shield's bearer are amplified and sound ten times louder than normal.
