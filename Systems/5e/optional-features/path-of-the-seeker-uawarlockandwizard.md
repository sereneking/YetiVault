# Path of the Seeker
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Seeker" Patron

The Seeker bids you to travel in search of knowledge, and little can prevent you from walking this path. You ignore difficult terrain, have advantage on all checks to escape a grapple, manacles, or rope bindings, and advantage on saving throws against being [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed).
