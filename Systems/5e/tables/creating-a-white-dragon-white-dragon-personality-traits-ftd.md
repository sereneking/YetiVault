| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Talkative people are usually the most dangerous. I like to eat them first. |
| 2 | I brood over past encounters with foes and sometimes mistake newcomers for my ancient enemies. |
| 3 | I can recall many tidbits of lore picked up over the centuries but have no sense of their import. |
| 4 | I don't like the taste of warm blood and always rinse my mouth out with snow after a fight. |
| 5 | Whenever I encounter a new type of creature, I try to lure it back to my lair so I can add it to my collection of frozen trophies. |
| 6 | I have named the wind that blows through my lair and speak to it often. It is my sole companion. |
| 7 | I meet any challenge to my territory with aggression, even if I can't win outright. |
| 8 | I feel protective of smaller, weaker creatures that are tormented by larger monsters. |
