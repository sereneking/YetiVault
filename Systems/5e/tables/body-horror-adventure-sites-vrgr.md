| dice: d8 | Adventure Site |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A derelict ship, buried for mysterious reasons |
| 2 | A vine-covered, ostensibly abandoned prison |
| 3 | The cavernous gut of a dead, multi-eyed behemoth |
| 4 | An inn in the valley, its insides dark and smoke-drowned |
| 5 | An asylum, abandoned save for vermin |
| 6 | A cave system, slick and comprised of gleaming black rock |
| 7 | An old church sitting astride a warren of ancient tunnels |
| 8 | A sprawling university, older than the town surrounding it, and older still than the memories of its inhabitants |
