# Deep Dragon Wyrmling
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 175*  

Making their lairs in the depths of the Underdark, deep dragons are nightmarish cousins of chromatic dragons. The warped magical energy of their subterranean realm gives them the ability to exhale magical spores that instill fear and scar the mind.

Deep dragons' black-and-gray hide is smooth like a salamander's, and their eyes are pale. As they age, their spore breath causes fungi to bloom across their skin, especially around the head and neck. Their wings are attached to their front legs and can fold in close to the body, allowing deep dragons to easily maneuver through relatively narrow tunnels.

Deep dragons often hoard secrets, delighting in knowledge of far-off lands. Many seek out new insights and tricks that they can use against other denizens of the Underdark, preferring social manipulation and crafty dealmaking to exerting themselves in combat. Deep dragons look down on any creature that isn't useful to them, though they are willing to bargain for knowledge they lack.

## Creating a Deep Dragon

Use the Deep Dragon Personality Traits and Deep Dragon Ideals tables to inspire your portrayal of distinctive deep dragon characters, and use the Deep Dragon Spellcasting table to help select spells for a spellcasting dragon.

### Deep Dragon Personality Traits

`dice: [](deep-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md#^trait)`

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | I will not risk injury at the hands of weaker creatures—especially while I can turn them against one another and have them fight in my stead. |
| 2 | It is difficult for anyone not of dragonkind to penetrate the twisting labyrinth of my thoughts. |
| 3 | I might disagree with other dragons, but we are superior beings and should not lower ourselves to direct conflict. |
| 4 | I have no interest in going to the surface world. It's where one sends one's servants. |
| 5 | While the petty squabbles of other creatures bore and irritate me, I might hear out those who demonstrate an appreciation for the finer things in life by bringing me delicacies like clams or aboleth flesh. |
| 6 | I might be willing to exert myself to take out a mind flayer. Those disgusting creatures must be stopped. |
| 7 | I dream of seeing the deepest places in the ocean. |
| 8 | I find I rather enjoy the company of people—as long as they remain unaware of my true nature. |

### Deep Dragon Ideals

`dice: [](deep-dragon-wyrmling-ftd.md#^ideal)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Understanding. True power comes from the ability to discern other creatures' motivations better than they can discern yours. (Any) |
| 2 | Kindred. All dragons are kin to one another, and we would all do well to prioritize that kinship. (Any) |
| 3 | Mystery. I appreciate a question I cannot answer, so I strive to be an enigma for other creatures. (Any) |
| 4 | Adaptability. Whether taking on a new form, making new allies, or trying a new strategy, flexibility keeps one youthful. (Chaotic) |
| 5 | Superiority. Weaker creatures cannot be trusted, so I constantly remind my servants of my power. (Evil) |
| 6 | Patience. All creatures might teach me something, and I'm willing to wait and find out what that might be rather than acting in haste. (Good) |

### Connected Creatures

Deep dragons appreciate the company of other dragons. Although they view most other species as inferior to dragonkind, having worth only as servants or tools, the rare individuals who impress them can sometimes earn respect as partners—albeit junior ones.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Nightmare Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales a cloud of spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`1d10`) psychic damage, and it is [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the dragon for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. A [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
