## Salvage

Within every mjork is a heart of ash hardened into smoky crystal. This crystal might already be broken in the remains of a slain mjork, making it useless. An intact crystal can be broken or hurled at a point up to 60 feet away as an action. When it breaks, which it does upon landing if hurled, the crystal releases a 20-foot-radius sphere of sooty smoke, centered on a point in the breaker's space or on the point where the crystal landed. The smoke spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute, but a moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it in 4 rounds. A strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 1 round. These crystals sell for 15 gp or more each.

The smaller crystals from sootlings or broken mjork crystals are like smoky quartz. These gems can be worth from 1 sp to 1 gp each, or more to collectors who believe they are mjork crystals. Someone who polishes them using jeweler's tools can increase their value as semiprecious stones.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Mjorks are made from earth and fire clashing together. These elementals often dwell near volcanoes.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Mjorks are vulnerable to thunder damage, which cracks their rocky skin. They can also sense through smoke as if the haze provided them blindsight.

## Traits

***Blinding Soot.*** A creature that takes fire damage from a mjork asher's attacks must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) until the end of the mjork's next turn.

***Fiery Body.*** A creature that touches the mjork asher or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage.

***Smoke Sense.*** A mjork asher in contact with smoke has blindsight in that smoke's area in a radius of up to 120 feet.

***Smoke Shroud.*** While the mjork asher has 41 or more hit points, smoke renders a sphere within 20 feet of it heavily obscured. This smoke goes around corners. Even while the mjork has 40 or fewer hit points, tendrils of this smoke extend to 60 feet from the mjork, providing smoke for the Smoke Sense of all mjorks. However, the whole shroud dissipates during any round the mjork is exposed to moderate (at least 10 miles per hour) or stronger wind.

***Water Susceptibility.*** For every 5 feet the mjork asher moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The mjork asher makes two attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage and 7 (`2d6`) fire damage and Blinding Soot.

***Hurl Soot.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+5` to hit, ranged 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`3d6 + 2`) fire damage and Blinding Soot.

***Create Sootlings (1/Day).*** The mjork asher chooses a point within 60 feet of it that it can sense. Smoke fills a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. This smoke lasts until the start of the mjork's next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Unless dispersed before the start of the mjork's next turn, a sootling swarm forms in a space in the area, favoring a space a creature hostile to the mjork occupies. The swarm takes its turn just after the mjork and obeys the mjork's verbal commands (no action for the mjork). If issued no commands, the swarm acts independently, often attacking a creature that isn't its ally. The swarm can survive indefinitely after being created.
