# Ardwyn, Elder of Meadowfen
*Source: Humblewood Campaign Setting p. 190*  

A venerable huden gallus with rounded grouse-like proportions and feathers that have long since lost the sheen of youth. As the village Elder, Ardwyn is a figure of authority within Meadowfen. She and her late husband kept the village running until his death, after which she took on the role alone. Elder Ardwyn is a kind and perceptive woman who exudes leadership. The villagers look to her for guidance. Ardwyn uses the [priest](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/priest.md) stat block, adjusted with the racial traits of a huden gallus. She is neutral good.

## Traits

***Glide.*** When falling at least 10 feet, Ardwyn can spend a reaction to fly up to her speed in one direction as she descends. She lands in an unoccupied space at the end of her movement, and takes no falling damage. She cannot glide while carrying heavy objects, heavy weapons, or shields (though she can drop any held items as part of her reaction).

***Wing Flap.*** As a bonus action, Ardwyn can use her powerful feathered arms to propel herself upward a distance equal to half her movement speed. She can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding. 

***Seedspeech.*** Ardwyn can communicate simple ideas to living plants, and is able to interpret their responses in simple language.

***Divine Eminence.*** As a bonus action, Ardwyn can expend a spell slot to cause her melee weapon attacks to magically deal an extra 10 (`3d6`) radiant damage to a target on a hit. This benefit lasts until the end of the turn. If Ardwyn expends a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage increases by `1d6` for each level above 1st.

***Spellcasting.*** Ardwyn is a 5th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, `+6` to hit with spell attacks). Ardwyn has the following cleric spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md), [sacred flame](/Systems/5e/spells/sacred-flame.md), [thaumaturgy](/Systems/5e/spells/thaumaturgy.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md), [guiding bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/guiding-bolt.md), [sanctuary](/Systems/5e/spells/sanctuary.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [lesser restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/lesser-restoration.md), [spiritual weapon](/Systems/5e/spells/spiritual-weapon.md)

**3rd level (2 slots)**: [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [spirit guardians](/Systems/5e/spells/spirit-guardians.md)

## Actions
