| 1 | You are a heretic, drawn to worship of Moradin. |
| 2 | Caught stealing, you escaped imprisonment but not before torture left you with a scar or lasting injury. |
| 3 | You were enslaved by drow or mind flayers but escaped to the surface. |
| 4 | You seek only to test yourself in battle with monsters. |
| 5 | Profit is all that matters to you. |
