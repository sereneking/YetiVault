# Star Angler
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 237*  

Distantly related to scavvers, star anglers are astral predators that resemble hulking, golden anglerfish with iridescent fins and tails. A star angler lacks eyes, and its hide is dotted with bioluminescent specks, allowing it to easily blend into the vast expanse of the Astral Plane. A star angler's signature lure emits an enchanting glow that has pulled many Wildspace explorers to their demises.

## Traits

***Avoidance.*** If the star angler is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails.

***Illumination.*** The star angler's lure sheds bright light in a 30- foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The star angler makes three Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) piercing damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Lure Charm.*** The star angler's lure flares with enchanting starlight, targeting one creature the star angler can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or have the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition until the start of the star angler's next turn. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the target has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition and must use its movement on its turn to move directly toward the star angler; a [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) target doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but it does avoid damaging terrain. A target can be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by only one star angler at a time.
