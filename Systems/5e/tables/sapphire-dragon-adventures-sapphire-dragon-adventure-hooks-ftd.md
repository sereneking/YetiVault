| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Posing as an avatar of an evil earth elemental-god, a sapphire dragon serves as general to a fanatical cult—and claims the spoils of the cult's victories. |
| 2 | A sapphire dragon is bound by an ancient pact to advise a monarchy on matters of defense—until someone bests the dragon's security measures. |
| 3 | A sapphire dragon seeks adventurers to lead into battle against the [mind flayers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) that usurped the dragon's lair. |
| 4 | Powerful infernal creatures have opened a portal in the middle of a city square. The key to closing the portal is a mythical holy weapon that happens to be the pride and joy of a sapphire dragon's hoard. |
| 5 | A sapphire dragon threatens to sink a town into the Underdark unless the authorities find and turn over a thief who stole from the dragon. |
| 6 | A village is beset by swarms of [giant spiders](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-spider.md) drawn to the area when a sapphire dragon took up residence nearby. Ridding the village of the spiders means tampering with the dragon's food supply. |
| 7 | A sapphire dragon invites warriors to vie for the honor of studying military tactics under the dragon. The front-runner is an infamous bandit leader who will undoubtedly terrorize the area if they win. |
| 8 | A sapphire dragon's lair is so well protected that its inner defenses have never been tested. The dragon spreads rumors of the treasures within to attract adventurers who can put the traps to the test. |
