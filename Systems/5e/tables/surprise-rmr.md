| dice: d12 | Surprise |
|-----------|----------|
| 1 | A ghostly hand appears and slaps a random character for `2d4` bludgeoning damage. If this kills them, they rise as a spectral presence that follows the group, endlessly slapping them as well. |
| 2 | Five [giant rats](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-rat.md) burst from the ground and attack. Name them after your favorite boy band. |
| 3 | Every magic potion the party carries has turned to spoiled milk. |
| 4 | Point at the character who last spoke. Their left foot has fallen asleep, causing them to suffer **âˆ’**1 Dexterity for an hour. |
| 5 | Two [flameskulls](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) fly in, accompanied by loud heavy metal music. They attack. |
| 6 | A lone [flameskull](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/flameskull.md) flies in, looking for his two friends who ditched him on the way to a heavy metal concert. He's confused and angry and also attacks. |
| 7 | The party hears a scraping noise coming from the nearby wall. Make it seem important to the story. Use this noise to focus the group and lead them to the next encounter. |
| 8 | A random character vomits up an [ochre jelly](/Systems/5e/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly.md). Describe the burning sensation as it erupts from the character's feeble mouth-hole. Make the party regret ever wasting your time. |
| 9 | A random character's favorite weapon just gained magical intelligence and starts nagging them about getting on with the adventure. |
| 10 | An arrow suddenly shoots out from the shadows and hits the character who is pissing you off. The character takes `1d6 + 4` piercing damage and should reconsider their current course of action. |
| 11 | Something gold and shiny catches the eye of a party member. What is it? Whatever you want. |
| 12 | Pick a random character. Tell them their esophagus is cursed. |
