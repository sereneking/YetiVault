# Gnarlid
*Source: Plane Shift: Zendikar p. 34*  

Gnarlids are about the size of a large dog and resemble a cross between a bear and a wolverine. They have horns with distinctive shapes that vary by species, and some varieties have similar spikes elsewhere on their bodies. They have an innate ability to grow larger by drawing on green mana in the environment, nearly doubling in size as well as ferocity. In this enlarged state, a gnarlid can be represented with the [brown bear](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/brown-bear.md) statistics in the Monster Manual. If some magic reduces its size, cut both its hit point maximum and its attack damage in half.
