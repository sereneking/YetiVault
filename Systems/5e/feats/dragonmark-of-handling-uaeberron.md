# Dragonmark of Handling
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Eberron p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: [Human](/Systems/5e/races/human.md)

You have the magical mark of Handling, the dragonmark of House Vadalis, and are a member of that house.

You gain the ability to innately cast spells and cantrips, using Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. You cast each spell at its lowest level. Once you cast a given spell this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it innately again. You must still expend any material components. Your dragonmark confers the following benefits:

## Greater Dragonmark
