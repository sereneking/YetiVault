# Fire Giant of Evil Fire
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 139, Giants of the Star Forge, Heroes' Feast: Saving the Children's Menu*  

A fire giant is born around flame, works with flame, and lives among flames, but a fire giant who gazes into flames too deeply may see the Prince of Evil Fire, Imix, gazing back. Giants who fall to Imix's corruption might leave their homes to join with likeminded cultists, but others remain within their communities to pursue Imix's destructive agenda.

A fire giant of Evil Fire forges a set of armor and weapons in flames blessed by Imix. The giant can then call on these magical flames to strike the foes of the Eternal Flame. The armor forged in these flames welds to the flesh, so while the giant isn't burned, the armor can't be removed once donned. When the giant dies, the armor explodes as a final gift from the All-Consuming Fire.

## Traits

***Shrapnel Explosion.*** When the giant drops to 0 hit points, its armor explodes, destroying the giant's body and scattering the armor as shrapnel. Creatures within 10 feet of the giant when its armor explodes must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (`6d6`) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two Searing Scepter attacks or two Bolt of Imix attacks.

***Searing Scepter.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`3d6 + 7`) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`2d8`) fire damage, and the target is magically branded. While branded in this way, the target becomes visible if it's [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible), can't become [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible), and sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. The brand disappears after 24 hours, or it can be removed from a creature or an object by any spell that ends a curse.

***Bolt of Imix.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+8` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (`3d10 + 4`) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or have the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition until the end of the target's next turn.
