**Irian Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](irian-the-eternal-dawn-irian-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^irian-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The waters of a spring hold curative powersâ€”curing disease, healing wounds, even restoring lost senses. |
| 2 | Clusters of radiant crystals sprout from the earth. A spell of 1st level or higher cast within 30 feet of these crystals, if it restores hit points or deals radiant damage, is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 3 | A maple tree with translucent, violet-hued bark and shimmering leaves grows in the heart of a swamp. Creatures that live near it age very slowly. |
| 4 | Undead within the zone have disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. |
