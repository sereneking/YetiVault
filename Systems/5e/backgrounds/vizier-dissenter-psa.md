# Vizier (Dissenter)
*Source: Plane Shift: Amonkhet p. 11*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History), [Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of artisan's tools, one type of musical instrument  
- **Equipment.** A set of artisan's tools or a musical instrument (one of your choice), a scroll of your god's teachings, a vizier's cartouche, a set of [fine clothes](/Systems/5e/items/fine-clothes.md), and a [pouch](/Systems/5e/items/pouch.md) containing 25 gp  

Even in the carefully constructed and curated city-state of Naktamun, and in the presence of the five gods, some people rebel against the doctrines of the God-Pharaoh. They don't challenge the existence of the gods, of course, for those gods are visible nearly every day in the streets of the city. Nor do they question the fact of life after death, which is plain to see in the anointed mummies that surround them, as well as the marauding mummies outside the Hekma. Rather, these dissenters simply refuse to follow the ordained course of life that leads to the glorious afterlife.

Some dissenters are spurred by fear, not wanting to subject themselves to a violent death in the trials (or in training for the trials). Some are moved by conscience, unwilling to kill their crop-mates in the trials. For while they cannot deny that the gods exist, they can deny that the gods are just—and can fight to prove that the dictates of an unjust god need not be obeyed. Some believe that one god (probably Bontu) has corrupted the process of the trials and the path to the afterlife. Others correctly intuit that the God-Pharaoh did not actually have the people's best interests in mind when he ordered their society.

A character who is identified as a dissenter loses the benefit of the initiate's or vizier's background feature. In its place, the character gains the Shelter of Dissenters feature.

You are a vizier, a servant of your god. You perform tasks that are essential to facilitating the initiates' journey, so the gods reward you with entry into the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh's blessing. You hope to achieve the most honored status in the afterlife by being the best possible servant to your god.

As a vizier, you can have any class, but you are especially likely to be a [cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md), a [druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md) (particularly if you serve Rhonas), or a [paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md).

## Feature: Shelter of Dissenters

If they wish to have any hope of survival, whether hiding within the city or cast out into the desert, dissenters must help each other. You can find a place to hide, rest, or recuperate among other dissenters. They will help shield you from those who hunt you, possibly even risking their lives for you.

## Suggested Characteristics

A vizier's characteristics strongly reflect the ideals and personality of the god they serve.
