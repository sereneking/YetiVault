# Thri-kreen Mystic
*Source: Boo's Astral Menagerie p. 61, Light of Xaryxis*  

Thri-kreen mystics use psionics to navigate difficult terrain in Wildspace, turn invisible, and drain life from their prey. They often serve as spelljammers aboard thri-kreen ships.

***Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The thri-kreen casts one of the following spells, requiring no spell components and using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability:

**At will**: [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md) (self only), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) (the hand is invisible)

**1/day each**: [freedom of movement](/Systems/5e/spells/freedom-of-movement.md) (self only), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The thri-kreen makes two Gythka attacks or four Psychic Bolt attacks.

***Gythka.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d8 + 1`) slashing damage.

***Psychic Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) psychic damage.

***Drain Vitality (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The thri-kreen targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 32 (`5d12`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The thri-kreen regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

## Bonus Actions

***Chameleon Carapace.*** The thri-kreen changes the color of its carapace to match the color and texture of its surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks it makes to hide in those surroundings.
