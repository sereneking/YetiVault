**Daanvi Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](daanvi-the-perfect-order-daanvi-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^daanvi-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | People who live in the manifest zone are inclined to follow duly enacted regulations without question, regardless of moral implications. |
| 2 | Creatures can't tell deliberate lies while in the area. |
| 3 | Flora and fauna are preternaturally orderly and homogeneous. Trees here grow in neat rows without needing to be tended, rocks are situated in geometric patterns, and identical cattle graze in unison. |
| 4 | A contingent of modrons is methodically deconstructing and reorganizing the zone, heedless of their effect on the other inhabitants. |
