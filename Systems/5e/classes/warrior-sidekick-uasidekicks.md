> [!note]
> this class is intended for NPC [sidekicks](/Systems/5e/rules/variant-rules/sidekicks-uasidekicks.md).

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

At 1st level, the sidekick gains proficiency in one saving throw of your choice: Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.

In addition, the sidekick gains proficiency in three skills of your choice from the following list: [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics), [Animal Handling](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Animal%20Handling), [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics), [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature), [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception), and [Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival). If the sidekick is a humanoid, it also gains proficiency with all armor, shields, and simple and martial weapons.

### Second Wind (Level 1)

Starting at 1st level, the sidekick can use a bonus action on its turn to regain hit points equal to `1d10` + its level in this class. Once it uses this feature, it must finish a short or long rest before it can use it again.

The sidekick can use this feature twice between rests starting at 18th level.

### Danger Sense (Level 2)

Beginning at 2nd level, the sidekick has advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that it can see, such as traps and spells. This feature doesn't work if the sidekick is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

### Improved Critical (Level 3)

Starting at 3rd level, the sidekick's attack rolls score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the `d20`.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

When you reach 4th level, and again at 6th, 8th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 19th level, the sidekick increases one ability score of your choice by 2, or the sidekick increases two ability scores of your choice by 1. The sidekick can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Proficiency Versatility (Level 4)

This change represents one of your skills atrophying as you focus on a different skill.

### Extra Attack (1 extra) (Level 5)

Beginning at 5th level, the sidekick can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on its turn.
