# Uvar (Storm Rune)
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter, Ranger, and Rogue p. 2*  

Using this rune, you can glimpse the future like a storm giant. While wearing or carrying an object inscribed with this rune, you have advantage on Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) checks, and you can't be surprised as long as you are not [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

In addition, you can invoke the rune as a bonus action to enter a prophetic state for 1 minute or until you're [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated). Until the state ends, when you or another creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check, you can use your reaction to cause the roll to have advantage or disadvantage. Once you invoke the rune, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
