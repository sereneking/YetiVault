# Knight of the Rose
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Rose, a group known for leadership, justice, and wisdom. Your resolve grants you these benefits:

- **Bolstering Rally.** When you roll initiative, you can choose up to three other creatures you can see within 30 of you. Each creature can gain temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Hit Die + your proficiency bonus + the ability modifier of the ability score increased by this feat. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  

> [!note] Membership in Multiple Knightly Orders
> 
> Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.
