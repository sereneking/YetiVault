Given purpose and power as the companion to Pur-van Suul, champion of the Matron of Ravens during the "Calamity", the black wolf Galdric was sealed within a [raven's slumber](/Systems/5e/items/ravens-slumber-tdcsr.md), one of several such relics made in the Matron's honor, and interred with his master in a tomb under the Marrowglade Loch in the distant land of "Othanzia".

Over twenty years ago, [Vaxil'dan of Vox Machina](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/champion-of-ravens-tdcsr.md) was named champion in Purvan's stead, and Galdric was released from his slumber and bestowed with the charge of guarding the "Parchwood" surrounding "Whitestone". This large and cunning wolf now stalks the woods as the city's silent protector, with the people crafting new legends about their bestial sentinel. On moonlit nights, some say you can see Galdric wander through the Greyfield, headed to the Matron of Ravens' shrine for communion.
