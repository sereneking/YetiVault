# Habbakuk's Blessing
*Charm*  

Habbakuk blesses your travels through the Northern Wastes. This charm grants you advantage on Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks made to notice the Wash's waters filling chasms.

Additionally, while traveling, you and up to 5 other creatures with you ignore "difficult terrain" outdoors in the Northern Wastes, allowing you to move at double the pace listed on the Northern Wastes Land Travel table (see the "Into the Wastes" section earlier in this chapter).

This charm vanishes 24 hours after you leave the Northern Wastes.
