To snare its prey, a giant spider spins elaborate webs or shoots sticky strands of webbing from its abdomen. Giant spiders are most commonly found underground, making their lairs on ceilings or in dark, web-filled crevices. Such lairs are often festooned with web cocoons holding past victims.

## Traits

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the spider knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (`2d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.

***Web (Recharge 5-6).*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by webbing. As an action, the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) target can make a DC 12 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
