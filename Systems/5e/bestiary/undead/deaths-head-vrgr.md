# Death's Head
*Source: Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 232*  

A death's head is a disembodied, flying head. The type of creature one of these grotesque undead originated from determines how it terrorizes it prey. A death's head that arises from a person or animal swoops down to rip apart victims with its gnashing teeth. One with the head of monster like a nothic or medusa, though, retains a measure of the power it had in life and can befuddle the minds or petrify the bodies of its victims.

## Death's Head Tree

In cursed wilds grow death's head trees, awakened trees from which `2d6` death's heads dangle like foul fruit. The heads detach to protect the tree if it's threatened. Should the tree be destroyed, the heads scatter and plant themselves in unholy ground. A new death's head tree emerges from each planted head `1d12` months later.
