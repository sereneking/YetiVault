# Sunder Shaman
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 202*  

Gruul sunder shamans are angry giants that channel their rage into brutal attacks that deal overwhelming damage to foes and structures alike.

These shamans sometimes lead hill giants and stone giants that also live among the Gruul Clans. They are occasionally joined by cyclopes, ettins, fomorians, and ogres. Like the rest of the Gruul, they hate the urban development that encroaches on the wilds where they once lived-not least because they have so much difficulty fitting inside the small structures. They delight in destroying such edifices, and in the heat of their rage, they walk through buildings, trample people underfoot, and generally cause as much chaos as possible. They often armor themselves with pieces of buildings and wield columns or other architectural elements as clubs.

## Giants

Giants use their tremendous size and strength to advance the cause of no less than four guilds. In the Boros Legion and the Orzhov Syndicate, they are cunning soldiers. The giants of the Cult of Rakdos and the Gruul Clans are no less effective but lack discipline.
