**Memorable Mission**

`dice: [](memorable-mission-erlw.md#^memorable-mission)`

| dice: d4 | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Betrayal**. A former associate turned against you. You escaped, and want revenge. |
| 2 | **Left in the Cold.** Things went wrong, and you had to make the terrible decision to abandon an ally. They might be dead, or they might be looking for revenge. |
| 3 | **The Perfect Operation**. Your actions made headlines across Khorvaire, shaping history for the next decade. Nobody knows you were involved, and sometimes you wish you could have a little credit for your work. |
| 4 | **The Standoff**. You met your match during a tense operation. Neither side got everything they wanted. You hate to admit it, but the team you went up against proved your match. Maybe you'll cross paths again. |
