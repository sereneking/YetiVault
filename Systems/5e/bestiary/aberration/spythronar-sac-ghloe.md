# Spythronar Sac

## Salvage

Spythronar silk is prized, although it's worthless if acid or fire touched the web. One web can be used to make silk rope or fine clothing. A proficient alchemist can use the same amount of silk to produce a [potion of lightning resistance](/Systems/5e/items/potion-of-lightning-resistance.md) or a dose of an oil that allows a metal weapon to deal `1d6` extra lightning damage for 1 hour. Producing either concoction takes 4 hours of work and a successful DC 13 Intelligence check.

A proficient weaver can turn three spythronar webs into a rope of entanglement or 10 webs into leather armor of lightning resistance. Doing either requires other materials worth 500 gp, 5 days of work, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Spythronar swarms can weave dangerous webbing, making egg sacs quickly. It takes them some time to weave a sentient web.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** The sentient spythronar webs adhere to you if you touch them, and they charge their silken strands with lightning. Crushing spythronar egg sacs sets off a lightning discharge, but hitting them with lightning releases a new spythronar swarm.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** The spythronar sac appears to be a tangled ball of string, twigs, and dirt. Someone who can see the sac can identify it with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana) or [Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)) check.

***Fragile.*** A creature who enters the spythronar sac's space must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, or the sac is destroyed.

***Lightning Release.*** When the spythronar sac is destroyed, it releases lightning in a 10-foot radius. A creature who destroyed the sac by entering its space receives no saving throw. Other creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (`1d8`) lightning damage. Each spythronar swarm and web in this area instead gains advantage on its next attack roll.

***Shocking Birth.*** When a spythronar sac takes lightning damage from a source other than another spythronar, it hatches, transforming into a spythronar swarm with half the normal hit points. This swarm rolls initiative and enters the combat.
