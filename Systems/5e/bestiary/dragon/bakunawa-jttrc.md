# Bakunawa
*Source: Journeys through the Radiant Citadel p. 147*  

Worshiped as draconic avatars of storm and tide, bakunawa soar over the archipelagos they call home. Iridescent scales crackling with lightning cover a bakunawa's fearsome serpentine body, and the sharp movements of its mighty wings echo with thunderous winds. Known for their mercilessness in battle, bakunawa swallow whole any who challenge them.

## Traits

***Amphibious.*** The bakunawa can breathe air and water.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the bakunawa fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The bakunawa makes one Bite attack and one Storm Slam attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the bakunawa. A swallowed creature is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the bakunawa. At the start of each of the bakunawa's turns, each swallowed creature takes 10 (`3d6`) lightning damage.

The bakunawa's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the bakunawa takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the bakunawa must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 15 feet of the bakunawa. If the bakunawa dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Storm Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (`1d10`) thunder damage, and the target is pushed up to 10 feet in a horizontal direction away from the bakunawa.

## Legendary Actions

***Nimble Glide.*** The bakunawa flies or swims up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Slam.*** The bakunawa makes one Storm Slam attack.

***Lightning Strikes (Costs 3 Actions).*** The bakunawa arcs lightning at up to two creatures it can see within 60 feet of itself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (`4d10`) lightning damage.
