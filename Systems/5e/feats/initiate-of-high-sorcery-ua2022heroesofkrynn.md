# Initiate of High Sorcery
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: Apprentice of High Sorcery

You've received training from magic-users affiliated with the Mages of High Sorcery. Choose one of the three moons of Krynn, each of which is associated with a distinct type of magic: the black moon, Nuitari; the red moon, Lunitari; or the white moon Solinari. You learn one cantrip and one 1st-level spell based on the moon you choose, as specified in the Lunar Spells table.

You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have.

Your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat).
