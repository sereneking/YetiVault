**Sigil Lady's Ward Encounters**

`dice: [](sigil-ladys-ward-encounters-sato.md#^sigil-ladys-ward-encounters)`

| dice: d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A tiefling wastrel ([noble](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/noble.md)) flicks a gambling chip from "Fortune's Wheel" at the party, lamenting, "May your luck be better than mine." |
| 2 | A deluxe sedan chair carried by four [veterans](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/veteran.md) stops in front of the characters. A gloved Humanoid hand parts its privacy curtain, extending them an invitation to a masked ball. |
| 3 | A cheery [drider](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/drider.md) skitters toward the party. A cultist of Lolth, the drider hands the party a pamphlet advertising an upcoming ritual at the "Infinite Well" (see the ""Lady's Ward Locations"" section). |
| 4 | A desperate [commoner](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) from a faction of your choice has an impending trial in the "High Courts of Sigil" (see the ""Lady's Ward Locations"" section). Unable to secure an advocate, they plead with the characters to represent them in court. |
| 5 | When the coast is clear, a shady-looking [Doomguard rot blade](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/doomguard-rot-blade-mpp.md) (see "Morte's Planar Parade") opens their long overcoat in front of the characters to reveal a slew of finely crafted weapons available for purchase. |
| 6 | Three [Harmonium peacekeepers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/harmonium-peacekeeper-mpp.md) escort a manacled [githzerai uniter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/githzerai-uniter-mpp.md) to the "Prison" (both stat blocks are in "Morte's Planar Parade"). As they pass the characters, the githzerai drops a crumpled note asserting their innocence. |
| 7 | A character spots a notice from the Mercykillers for an escaped prisoner who bears an uncanny resemblance to someone in the party. |
| 8 | Atop a low building, a [githyanki warrior](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/githyanki-warrior.md) proselytizes furiously to the characters about Aoskar, the Keeper of Gateways, claiming to have seen the dead god alive and well on the Astral Plane. As Harmonium officers move to arrest the githyanki, he mysteriously vanishes. |
