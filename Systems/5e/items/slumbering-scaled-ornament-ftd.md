# Slumbering Scaled Ornament
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  


This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon's scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

You have advantage on saving throws you make to avoid being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) or to end those conditions on you.
