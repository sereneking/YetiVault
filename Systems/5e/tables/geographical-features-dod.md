| dice: d8 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A colossal, gnarled tree, its trunk riddled with passageways, halls, chambers, and staircases |
| 2 | A valley filled with grassy meadows and groves of trees along a running river, nestled between two snow-capped mountains that look like the points of a crescent moon |
| 3 | A crystal castle that sings in sunlight or moonlight |
| 4 | A vast thicket of thick roots, thorny vines, and sinuous creepers that weave together to form long tunnels, grand hallways, and enormous domes |
| 5 | A complex of caves connected by passageways formed by Fey magic to create grand galleries and soaring vaults |
| 6 | Rolling farmland that yields healthy, bountiful produce of amazing size |
| 7 | A forest of tower-sized mushrooms, or a forest of tiny mushrooms that characters must shrink down to explore |
| 8 | An island that is actually a colossal sleeping turtle |
