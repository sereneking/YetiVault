# Winter's Dark Bite
*Melee Weapon, uncommon*  

- **Damage**: 2d6 S

This greatsword is made of an unknown black metal. In most cases, it works as a [+1 greatsword](/Systems/5e/items/1-weapon.md). But when used against a [thessalhydra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/thessalhydra-hftt.md), it works as a [+3 greatsword](/Systems/5e/items/3-weapon.md). While in the Upside Down, it works as a +4 greatsword.
