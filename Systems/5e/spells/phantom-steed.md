# Phantom Steed
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Illusion (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the creature's appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.

For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed. The creature uses the statistics for a [riding horse](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/riding-horse.md), except it has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.
