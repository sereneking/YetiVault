# Relaxation
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 10* 

Sometimes, the best thing a character can do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, this is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break.

## Resources

Relaxation requires one week. You need to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefits. You also need to stay at home, at an inn, or in some other location that affords rest.

## Resolution

While relaxing, you gain advantage on saving throws to recover from long-term diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, you can end one effect that prevents you from regaining hit points or restore one ability score that has been reduced to below its normal value, unless the harmful effect is caused by a spell or other magical effect with an ongoing duration.

## Complications

Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life interesting for the characters, introduce an action or event connected to a foil.
