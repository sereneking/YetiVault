**Outlands Undead**

`dice: [](outlands-undead-mpp.md#^outlands-undead)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | The characters find a trapped [crawling claw](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw.md). Rather than attacking, the severed hand can lead the characters to the thankful immortal who lost it. |
| 2 | A [banshee](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/banshee.md) influenced by "Acheron" appears as a fallen knight-commander with a legion of [specters](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md). Guardians of the gate-town of Rigus hire the characters to help banish the phantom army. |
| 3 | A [lich](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/lich.md) seeks to dominate the gate-town of Hopeless and see it dragged into Hades with himself as its ruler. Citizens of the gate-town entreat the characters to keep the gate-town hopeful enough that it doesn't fall into the Lower Plane. |
| 4 | Several confused [ghost](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) "petitioners" have become lost. They seek someone to pass judgment on their lives and deliver them to the proper planes. |
