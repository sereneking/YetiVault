# Wolf of the Overworld
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: Minecraft Creatures p. 7, Lightning Keep*  

Running through the forests of the Overworld on four legs, this gray-furred hunter is at home in the cold of the taiga.

Wolves hunt in packs, roaming their territories and chasing sheep, rabbits, and foxes. Wild wolves are typically indifferent to Humanoids, neither running from nor attacking them, but a pack of wolves becomes hostile toward any creature that hurts one of the pack's members. Wolves can be tamed by adventurers who feed and look after them. Tamed wolves follow their masters everywhere they go.

Wolves instinctively regard animated skeletons as enemies and attack them without hesitation. Even tamed wolves, which obediently hold themselves back from attacking their natural prey, freely charge at skeletons unless they are commanded to sit.
