## Traits

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Torlin has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Torlin makes two longsword attacks or two longbow attacks. It can use its Life Drain in place of one longsword attack.

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

A humanoid slain by this attack rises 24 hours later as a [zombie](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) under Torlin's control, unless the humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed. Torlin can have no more than twelve zombies under its control at one time.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) slashing damage, or 7 (`1d10 + 2`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage.
