| dice: d8 | Trinket |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A polished crystal sphere; when you clutch it in your fist, a telepathic voice recites a story in your mind |
| 2 | A teardrop pendant made from polished shell; when you hold it, you see the image of a young Riedran man |
| 3 | A six-sided crystal die; when you roll it, you feel a surge of emotion for six seconds |
| 4 | A sealed vial filled with faintly luminescent blue mist |
| 5 | A crystal disk engraved with a labyrinthine pattern |
| 6 | A leather-bound collection of kalashtar poetry called *Shards of the Light* |
| 7 | A sphere of polished crystal; when you hold it in your palm, you feel that it knows you and understands you |
| 8 | A cup and ball toy; when you successfully catch the ball in the cup, you feel a momentary surge of joy |
