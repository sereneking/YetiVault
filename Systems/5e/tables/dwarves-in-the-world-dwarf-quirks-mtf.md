|----------|-------|
| 1 | Water from the sky! It always surprises you. |
| 2 | You have a fascination with the ocean and its chaos. |
| 3 | Any creature larger than a human makes you nervous. |
| 4 | You prefer to travel with a parasol or similar item that puts a comforting shelter over your head. |
| 5 | You prefer to sleep during the day. |
| 6 | You speak Common or any other non-dwarf language only if you must. |
| 7 | For you, relaxation is putting in a day at the forge. |
| 8 | You avoid contact with other dwarves, since you mistrust those who would leave their strongholds. |
