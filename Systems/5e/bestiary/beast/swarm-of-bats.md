> [!note] The Nature of Swarms
> 
> The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a [yuan-ti abomination](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/yuan-ti-abomination.md) might have [swarms of poisonous snakes](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-poisonous-snakes.md) slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.

## Traits

***Echolocation.*** The swarm can't use its blindsight while [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened).

***Keen Hearing.*** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny bat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 5 (`2d4`) piercing damage, or 2 (`1d4`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
