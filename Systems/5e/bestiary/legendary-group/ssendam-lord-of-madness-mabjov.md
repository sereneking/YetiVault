# Ssendam, Lord of Madness

## Lair actions
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Ssendam can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; Ssendam can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- All creatures within 30 ft. of Ssendam must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or come under the effects of the [confusion](/Systems/5e/spells/confusion.md) spell until the end of its next turn.  
- Until the end of Ssendam's next turn, any creature that casts a spell within 60 ft. of Ssendam must roll on the sorcerer's wild surge table in the PHB.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Ssendam's lair is corrupted by the chaos phage, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Within 1 mile of Ssendam's lair, there is a 1 in 20 chance that any creature that casts a spell must roll on the sorcerer's wild surge table in the PHB.  
- Within 10 miles of the lair, any creature that takes a long or short rest must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be inflicted with a random shortterm madness.  

If Ssendam dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
