# Metallic Peacekeeper
*Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons p. 210*  

When a metallic dragon grows attached to a settlement of smaller folk—often after dwelling there for a time in Humanoid form—the dragon might decide to create a metallic peacekeeper to protect the place. The peacekeeper can ward a community for centuries, standing in the place of its dragon creator and maintaining peace and order.

## Metallic Sentinels

A metallic sentinel is a guardian created by a metallic dragon, forged from the metal associated with its creator and powered by the energy of the dragon's breath. An artificial being sculpted in elegant filigree, it is dedicated to defusing tensions that could spiral into violence.

## Traits

***Immutable Form.*** The peacekeeper is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Telepathic Bond.*** While the peacekeeper is on the same plane of existence as its master, it can magically convey what it senses to its master, and the two can communicate telepathically with each other.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The peacekeeper makes two Slam attacks.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`3d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage.

***Calming Mist (Recharge 5-6).*** The peacekeeper releases a calming gas in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or become [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the peacekeeper for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the creature is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and has a speed of 0.
