# Green Lord's Gift
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Warlock and Wizard p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: "The Archfey" Patron

The Green Lord oversees a verdant realm of everlasting summer. Your soul is linked to his power. Whenever you regain hit points, you treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points you regain as having rolled their maximum value.
