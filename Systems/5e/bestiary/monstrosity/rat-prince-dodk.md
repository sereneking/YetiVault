# Rat Prince
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 213*  

This ratling stands head-and-shoulders over the others, and has black-brown fur and a wicked grin - some of his frontmost teeth are delerium crystals. He wears scavenged bits of light armour, tattered dark blue rags, and a gold crown which is slightly too small for his head.
