# Zargon the Returner

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zargon can take one of the following lair actions; it can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Dissolution.** Zargon dissolves into a glob of slime, seeps to an unoccupied space anywhere in the lair without provoking opportunity attacks, then re-forms.  
- **Spell Breaker.** Zargon targets up to two creatures it can see within the lair. All spells of 5th level or lower affecting the targets end.  
- **Sucking Slime.** Zargon creates a 20-foot-radius puddle of slime on the ground centered on a point within the lair. The slime is difficult terrain, and each creature in that area when the slime appears has the grappled condition (escape DC 15). Aberrations and Oozes are unaffected by the slime. The slime lasts until Zargon dies or until it uses this lair action again.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Zargon's lair is warped by Zargon's unnatural presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Arcane Enervation.** Enemies of Zargon within 1 mile of the lair have disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration.  
- **Corrupted Water.** Rain and water sources within 1 mile of the lair are tainted. A creature that drinks the water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the poisoned condition until it finishes a long rest.  
- **Eerie Weather.** The area within 10 miles of the lair experiences strange weather patterns that defy the region's typical climate.  

If Zargon dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
