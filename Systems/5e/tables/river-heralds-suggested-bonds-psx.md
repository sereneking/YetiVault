|-----------|------|
| 1 | I have carried on secret trade with a Sun Empire merchant for years now. |
| 2 | I am related to the shaman of my band. |
| 3 | I am fascinated by the culture and beliefs of the strangers in our land. |
| 4 | A small tributary to the Great River is in my care, and I will do anything to defend it. |
| 5 | I aspire to become the leader of my bandâ€”either as a shaman, or by supplanting the shaman as a war leader. |
| 6 | I will one day find the Immortal Sun and use its power to drive the invaders from our land. |
