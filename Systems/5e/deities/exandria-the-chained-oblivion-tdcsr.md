It is darkness unending, less like a god and more like another world of malevolent, alien intelligence. Life and death do not exist within the Chained Oblivion; only the absolute end of all things. Few minds can comprehend the depth of oblivion. Most who do are so completely lost to nihilistic despair or denial that they devote the rest of their lives to hastening the end of this reality so that it may be swallowed up by the great inevitability: utter, tenebrous cold.

Even the other "Betrayer Gods" treat the Oblivion with caution. In its endless imprisonment, it dreams nightmarish aberrations into existence, deep beneath Exandria. The Chained Oblivion's demented cultists work without word from their twisted patron, awaiting the Epoch of Ends, when its freedom will be attained and all beings shall be consumed in deathlessness unending.

## Depiction

Few visual attempts to depict the Chained Oblivion exist, but texts describe a creature of roiling ink and hungry darkness, a spreading cloud of lightless destruction born from a thousand ravenous mouths. Current references show the nightmare constrained by chains of black and gold, barely keeping the dark at bay.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Chained Oblivion's clerics are granted powers of Death, Grave, or Trickery.

## Enemies

The few remaining followers of the Knowing Mentor, who was gravely wounded by the Oblivion in ancient times, are dedicated to ensuring that the Chained Oblivion is never again unchained. Their goddess led the charge against the all-consuming god's reemergence, and her bravery allowed the other "Prime Deities" to shackle their enemy, though the victory nearly cost the Mentor her immortal life. Some say the Knowing Mentor can only be fully restored if the Chained Oblivion is fully destroyedâ€”for good.

- Offer light and life into its all-consuming maw so that it may surpass all divinities and be freed.  
- Uncover, restore, and exalt forgotten shrines and relics in its honor.  
- Ruin and raze the realms to hasten the arrival of the Epoch of Ends.
