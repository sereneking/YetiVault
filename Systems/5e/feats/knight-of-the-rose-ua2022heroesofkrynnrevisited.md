# Knight of the Rose
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Heroes of Krynn Revisited p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You are a Knight of Solamnia aligned with the Order of the Rose, a group known for leadership, justice, and wisdom. Your resolve grants you these benefits:

- **Rose Maneuvers.** You learn the [Commander's Strike](/Systems/5e/optional-features/commanders-strike.md) or [Rally](/Systems/5e/optional-features/rally.md) maneuver from the Battle Master subclass of the fighter in the Player's Handbook (choose the maneuver when you gain this feat). Whenever you finish a long rest, you can replace the maneuver you learned from this feat with the other maneuver offered by it.  
- **Superiority Dice.** You gain two superiority dice, which you add to the dice you have from the Squire of Solamnia feat. All the dice are now d8s.  

> [!note] Membership in Multiple Knightly Orders
> 
> Knights of Solamnia are only ever members of one of their organization's orders. In the course of their training, most knights begin as members of the Knights of the Crown and then move on to join other orders. Whether a character follows this path or another, they retain what they learned as a member of an order even if they join another. Characters can change what knightly order they're a part of, but they always have access to any Knight of Solamnia feats they've acquired.
