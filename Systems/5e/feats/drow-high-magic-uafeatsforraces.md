# Drow High Magic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 2*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf (Drow)](/Systems/5e/races/elf-drow.md)

You learn more of the spells typical for your people. You learn [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md) and [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
