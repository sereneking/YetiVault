**Hag Ideals**

`dice: [](roleplaying-a-hag-hag-ideals-vgm.md#^hag-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Change. I will metamorphose into every kind of hag and live a century as each, becoming something even greater in the end. (Chaotic) |
| 2 | Community. Loneliness is the path to madness. That is why I have minions to keep me company. (Lawful) |
| 3 | Greed. I will acquire the rarest and most valuable holy treasures to keep them from being used for good. (Evil) |
| 4 | Independence. I neither require nor want a coven. I will not be someone's equal. (Neutral) |
| 5 | Power. I will become an auntie or a grandmother, even if I have to kill my own mother to do it. (Evil) |
| 6 | Ugliness. I want to be envied for my appearance and my cruel heart. (Evil) |
