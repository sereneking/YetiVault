# Animated Table
*Source: Tales from the Yawning Portal p. 230*  

## Arundil's Animated Objects

A century ago, the dwarf mage Arundil animated a number of objects to defend the Foundry against intruders other than dwarves. Many of these creations remain in place today.

These animated objects never attack dwarves or duergar. In addition, a dwarf (including a duergar) can order an object to cease its attack. If so commanded, the object becomes immobile for 10 minutes, or until the one commanding it leaves the area.

### Constructed Nature

An animated table doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Traits

***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The table is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) while in the area of an [antimagic field](/Systems/5e/spells/antimagic-field.md). If targeted by [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), the table must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall [unconscious](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the table remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal table.

***Charge.*** If the table moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (`2d8`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Actions

***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6`, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.
