# Planecaller's Codex
*Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a wizard)*  

- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

The pages of this book are bound in fiend hide, and its cover is embossed with a diagram of the Great Wheel of the multiverse. When found, the book contains the following spells: [banishment](/Systems/5e/spells/banishment.md), [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md), [gate](/Systems/5e/spells/gate.md), [magic circle](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-circle.md), [planar binding](/Systems/5e/spells/planar-binding.md), and [summon elemental](/Systems/5e/spells/summon-elemental-tce.md). It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the conjuration school.  
- When you cast a conjuration spell that summons or creates one creature, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature advantage on attack rolls for 1 minute.
