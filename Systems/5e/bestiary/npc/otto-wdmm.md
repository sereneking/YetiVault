## Traits

***The Colors of Age.*** A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.

Red—5 years or less

Orange—6–10 years

Yellow—11–20 years

Green—21–30 years

Blue—31–40 years

Indigo—41–50 years

Violet—51 years or more

A green or older faerie dragon's CR increases to 2.

***Superior Invisibility.*** As a bonus action, the dragon can magically turn [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) until its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the dragon wears or carries is [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with it.

***Limited Telepathy.*** Using telepathy, the dragon can magically communicate with any other faerie dragon within 60 feet of it.

***Magic Resistance.*** The faerie dragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components:

**1/day each**: [color spray](/Systems/5e/spells/color-spray.md), [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md), [hallucinatory terrain](/Systems/5e/spells/hallucinatory-terrain.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md), [major image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md), [minor illusion](/Systems/5e/spells/minor-illusion.md), [mirror image](/Systems/5e/spells/mirror-image.md), [polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/polymorph.md), [suggestion](/Systems/5e/spells/suggestion.md)

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* `2d6 + 4` piercing damage.

***Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a `d6` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:

1–4. The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.

5–6. The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
