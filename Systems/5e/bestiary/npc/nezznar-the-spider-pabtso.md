# Nezznar the Spider
*Source: Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk p. 74*  

The Spider—a drow mastermind named Nezznar—is searching Wave Echo Cave for the Forge of Spells, a magical forge that was used by dwarves and gnomes in bygone days to fashion powerful magic items.

The Spider wants Wave Echo Cave for himself, and he's taking steps to make sure no one else knows where it is.
