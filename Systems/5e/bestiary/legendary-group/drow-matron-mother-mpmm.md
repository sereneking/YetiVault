# Drow Matron Mother

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the drow can take one of the following lair actions when in her lair; she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Perceive Interlopers.** The drow projects her mind throughout her lair, marking any potential threats against her or her retinue. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, hostile creatures within the lair can't become hidden from her and gain no benefit from the [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) condition against her.  
- **Spectral Web.** A glistening spectral spider web erupts from a point the drow can see within 120 feet of her. Each creature within 60 feet of that point must succeed a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Telekinetic Throw.** The drow targets one creature she can see within 60 feet of her and attempts to expel it from her presence. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be flung `2d6 Ã— 10` feet through the air. A creature smashed into a solid object takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet moved. If released in midair, the creature takes falling damage as normal.
