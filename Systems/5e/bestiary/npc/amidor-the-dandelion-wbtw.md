# Amidor the Dandelion
*Source: The Wild Beyond the Witchlight p. 135*  

## Roleplaying Notes

This 3-foot-tall talking dandelion finds poetry in everything and is quick to fall head over heels in love. A humble idealist, Amidor never puts its own needs above the needs of others.

### Alignment

Neutral good.

### Personality Trait

"My speech drifts into flowery verse, if you'll pardon the pun. Allow

me to demonstrate: Do not cry, my love! Let me catch your tears as faeries collect morning dew. Let me lift your spirits like a seed on the breeze!"

### Ideal

"The pursuit of true love compels me! Never shall I wilt if I have such a cause to champion."

### Bond

"The beautiful Pollenellaâ€”a vision in stripes."

### Flaw

"I cannot resist a pretty face or a heavenly scent."
