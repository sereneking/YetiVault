# Forest Marauder
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 191*  

*A relatively diminutive giant stalks beneath the forest's dark canopy, large spear in hand.*

## Painted Skin

Roughly the size and shape of an ogre, the forest marauder is covered in paint or colored mud. An exaggerated brow ridge juts out over close-set eyes, and corded muscle stands out all over the giant.

## Keep to the Wilderness

Cruel and savage when encountered, the forest marauders' demeanor has worked against them, and they have nearly been driven to extinction in places where they can be easily tracked. They have since learned to raid far from their hidden homes, leading to sightings in unexpected places.

## Orc Friends

Forest marauders get along well with orcs and goblins, who appreciate their brute strength and their skill at night raids.
