|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The ghost of a murdered giant monarch appears to the monarch's heirs and demands they claim vengeance. The heirs and the murderer end up in a wide-ranging conflict that threatens to devastate settlements near the giants' realm. |
| 2 | Convinced she is the rightful ruler of another giant's domain, a giant launches an invasion, heedless of the inhabitants of the lands between the giants' realms. |
| 3 | Believing his sovereign has violated the ordning by promoting an inferior giant instead of him, a scheming giant hires adventurers to undermine the sovereign's authority. |
| 4 | Seeking to impress a fire giant, a frost giant tries to bind a powerful elemental, but the elemental escapes and rampages across the region. |
| 5 | A dejected storm or cloud giant causes a drought or flooding across nearby farmlands. |
| 6 | After being insulted by a giant sovereign, a noble giant schemes to open a portal to the Abyss and summon a demon lord to destroy the sovereign's settlement. The site becomes a festering sinkhole of evil as demons roam the surrounding area. |
