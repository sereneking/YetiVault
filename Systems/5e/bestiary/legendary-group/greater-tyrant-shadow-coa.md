# Greater Tyrant Shadow

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the greater tyrant shadow can take one lair action to cause the following effect; it can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Despair.** One creature within 300 feet of the shadow must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be overcome with despair and self-doubt. The creature has the stunned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  
- **Renewal.** The shadow recharges its Shadows of Death ability.
