## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Grazilaxx has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** Grazilaxx's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

**At will**: [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md)

**1/day each**: [dominate monster](/Systems/5e/spells/dominate-monster.md), [plane shift](/Systems/5e/spells/plane-shift.md) (self only)

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Grazilaxx can innately cast can cast the [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md) spell once per day, but the intended destination must be within 30 feet of another society member. This teleport effect can be disrupted (see "Faerzress"), which is how society members sometimes end up in far corners of the Underdark, separated from their fellows.

**1/day each**: [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md)

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) humanoid [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by Grazilaxx. *Hit:* The target takes 55 (`10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, Grazilaxx kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** Grazilaxx magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`4d8 + 4`) psychic damage and be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
