# Crashing a Ship
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 9* 

If a ship moves into the space occupied by a creature or object, it might crash. A ship avoids crashing if the creature or object is at least two sizes smaller than it.

When a ship crashes, it must immediately make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage to its hull based on the size of the creature or object it crashed into, as shown on the Crash Damage table. It also stops moving if the object or creature is bigger than it or one size smaller. Otherwise the ship continues moving and the creature or object moves to the nearest unoccupied space that is not in the ship's path. At the DM's discretion, an object that is forced to move but is fixed in place is instead destroyed

A creature struck must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the ship's Strength modifier, taking damage based on the ship's size (as shown on the Crash Damage table) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
