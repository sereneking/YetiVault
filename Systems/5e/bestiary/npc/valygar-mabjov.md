Valygar Corthola is a ranger who was born into a wealthy family of powerful wizards. Many members of the Corthala bloodline have demonstrated magical aptitude and skill throughout its generations, and his ancestors include Lavok Corthala, a legendary necromancer.

Valygar's own mother was a mage who suffered from mental health issues, like many in her family. Valygar believed this affliction to be the result of her arcane practices. She spent much of the family's wealth on magical items to the point of obsession and wholly neglected her son and husband.

When Valygar's father died his mother was distraught. In her despair, she raised her partner as a zombie and underwent the process of becoming undead herself. Ultimately, Valygar slew both of his parents, a deed he felt he was compelled to carry out.

Convinced the family's obsessive pursuit of the arcane arts had corrupted and destroyed all he loved, Valygar grew to hate and despise those who used magic. Turning his back on his family legacy, he now specializes in hunting wizards and other magic users to rid the world of their evil practices.

He found that his skills and values were a good match for the monks of Candlekeep. Candlekeep's pursuit of ancient texts means that Valygar often comes into conflict with evil magic users.

While Valygar appears to be a man in his 50s, he is over a century in age. Normally Valygar turns his back on magical items, but he has made an exception for potions of longevity in order to reduce his physical age and continue his obsessive hunt of evil wizards. While the potions make his body younger, they have no effect on his lifespan and thus Valygar knows that death could come for him at any moment.
