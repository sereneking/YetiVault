# Eldritch Adept
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2020 Feats p. 1*  

**Prerequisite**: Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

Studying occult lore, you have unlocked eldritch power within yourself: you learn one [Eldritch Invocation](/Systems/5e/optional-features/list-eldritch-invocation.md) option of your choice from the warlock class. If the invocation has a prerequisite, you can choose that invocation only if you're a warlock and only if you meet the prerequisite.

Whenever you gain a level, you can replace the invocation with another one from the warlock class.
