## Traits

***Shapechanger.*** The keeper can use its action to polymorph into a raven-humanoid hybrid or into a raven, or back into its human form. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its human form if it dies.

***Mimicry.*** The keeper can mimic simple sounds it has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) check.

***Regeneration.*** The keeper regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the keeper takes damage from a silvered weapon or a spell, this trait doesn't function at the start of the keeper's next turn. The keeper dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spellcasting.*** The keeper is a 4th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, `+4` to hit with spell attacks). It has the following druid spells prepared:

**Cantrips (at will)**: [druidcraft](/Systems/5e/spells/druidcraft.md), [produce flame](/Systems/5e/spells/produce-flame.md), [shillelagh](/Systems/5e/spells/shillelagh.md)

**1st level (4 slots)**: [entangle](/Systems/5e/spells/entangle.md), [longstrider](/Systems/5e/spells/longstrider.md), [speak with animals](/Systems/5e/spells/speak-with-animals.md), [thunderwave](/Systems/5e/spells/thunderwave.md)

**2nd level (3 slots)**: [animal messenger](/Systems/5e/spells/animal-messenger.md), [barkskin](/Systems/5e/spells/barkskin.md)
