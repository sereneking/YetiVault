The evil queen of dragons is a fearsome god of greed, envy, and hoarded wealth. While chromatic dragons are her foremost worshipers, the Scaled Tyrant accepts the worship of any who crave wealth. All chromatic dragons have a fearful reverence for their tyrannical queen, but many dragons of near-deific power and ambition chafe under her rule. Though the Scaled Tyrant was pleased by the devastation that the "Chroma Conclave" spread across Exandria, the prideful "Conclave" never considered themselves subservient to the Dragon Queen.

## Depiction

Most visual representations of the Scaled Tyrant exist as warnings within sanctuaries of the Platinum Dragon. She is shown as a dragon of frightful size with five vicious dragon heads, each one a chromatic color of her evil children. Massive, leathery wings sprout from her back, spreading clouds of poisonous mist.

## Divine Domains

Many of the Scaled Tyrant's clerics are granted powers of Order, Trickery, or War.

## Enemies

The Scaled Tyrant's hatred for the Platinum Dragon is as old as the "Founding", and her cults are ever-hunted by his justice. For centuries, the zealous paladins of the Platinum Dragon have limited the Tyrant's worship to the chromatic dragons, but sects of humanoid dragon-worshipers appeared in the wake of the "Chroma Conclave's" destruction of "Emon", and have been secretly keeping her faith alive in the generation since the Conclave's defeat. Some Tal'Dorei oligarchs have even turned to the Scaled Tyrant in secret, as their hoarded wealth begins to run dry, sapped by the immense cost of rebuilding what was lost to the "Conclave".

- Amass wealth, but spend little. The gold—and the power that comes with it—is sufficient reward in itself.  
- Do not forgive nor forget an indignity to yourself. Let no affront go unpunished.  
- Take what you covet. Those without the strength to defend their dominion are not worthy of it.
