**Rigus Adventures**

`dice: [](rigus-adventures-sato.md#^rigus-adventures)`

| dice: d4 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | The [arcanaloth](/Systems/5e/bestiary/fiend/arcanaloth.md) Fetchtatter pays the characters to steal an infernal war machine from "Ribcage" so it can be sold to a general in Rigus. |
| 2 | The avatar of an evil deity of war (use the planar incarnate stat block from "Morte's Planar Parade") emerges from the "Lion's Gate" to destroy Rigus. |
| 3 | A [mummy lord](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/mummy-lord.md) in the "Crown" commands General Braahg to implement an outdated strategy. Risking treason, the hobgoblin hires the characters to lay his superior to rest. |
| 4 | The [ghost](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/ghost.md) of a fallen warrior asks the party to investigate why their name isn't on the "Final Procession". The culprit is a petty Crown General who took credit for the warrior's heroism. |
