# Topaz Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Beguiling Whisper.** The dragon telepathically whispers to one creature within range of the dragon's telepathy. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by the dragon until initiative count 20 on the next round. A creature [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way obeys to the best of its ability any command the dragon issues that isn't directly harmful to the creature.  
- **Cancellation.** The dragon chooses an active spell of 5th level or lower that it's aware of in the lair and ends the spell.  
- **Negative Energy Infusion.** Up to two creatures the dragon can see within the lair must each succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage. Negative energy then infuses the lair until initiative count 20 on the next round. While the infusion lasts, creatures in the lair other than the dragon can't regain hit points.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region surrounding a legendary topaz dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Crystal Profusion.** Natural stone within 6 miles of the lair grows plentiful crystal formations and veins of topaz gemstones, particularly underground.  
- **Negative Energy.** When a creature finishes a long rest within 6 miles of the lair, the creature must first succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be unable to reduce its levels of [exhaustion](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion) or regain spent Hit Dice. Creatures resistant or immune to necrotic damage are immune to this regional effect.  
- **Thriving Wildlife.** Giant squid are attracted to the sea within 6 miles of the lair, migrating and hunting there in large numbers.  
- **Watery Sight.** Water within 6 miles of the lair is a conduit for the dragon's psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any body of water in that region.  

If the dragon dies, the population of giant squid in the region returns to normal levels over the course of `1d10` days. The existing abundance of crystals and topazes remains, but new ones form at a normal rate.
