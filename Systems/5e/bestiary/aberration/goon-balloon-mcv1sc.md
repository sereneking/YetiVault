# Goon Balloon
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 1: Spelljammer Creatures p. 9*

> We found several of the creatures in an astral diamond mine at the edge of Greyspace. The miners wanted us to eliminate them. Our warlock, who was fluent in Deep Speech, managed to convince the bulbous creatures to relocate peacefully. They insisted we take them to a small, misshapen moon that doesn't appear on our charts. A horrible fear grips me. What if they're leading us into a trap?

A goon balloon looks like a 5-foot-diameter beach ball with clawed feet. Unblinking eyes on the outer surface of its spherical air sac enable the creature to see in all directions at once. These eyes can produce kaleidoscopic light that tears at the minds of the goon balloon's foes.

A goon balloon speaks by pumping air through a hidden orifice on its underside. When the goon balloon dies, the air in its sac transforms into a noxious gas that bursts from the corpse, potentially poisoning other creatures nearby.

Although they can seem playful and harmless, goon balloons are quite mean-spirited. They like to observe the suffering of other creatures and orchestrate that suffering, given half a chance.

## Traits

***Burst.*** The goon balloon bursts when it drops to 0 hit points, releasing noxious gas in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Creatures in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 minute. A [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Unusual Nature.*** The goon balloon doesn't require air, food, or drink.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The goon balloon makes two Claw attacks.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+2` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d6`) slashing damage.

***Scintillating Eye.*** Magical, kaleidoscopic light emanates from one of the goon balloon's eyes as the goon balloon targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, taking 6 (`1d12`) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bonus Actions

***Float.*** The goon balloon moves up to 20 feet vertically in one direction without provoking opportunity attacks. If it ends this movement suspended in the air, it hovers in place. It can't be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) while airborne.
