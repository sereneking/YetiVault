**Green Ideals**

`dice: [](green-ideals-psx.md#^green-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Acceptance.** Things are as they are for a reason, and it's foolish to try to change them. |
| 2 | **Nature.** The natural world is more important than the constructs of civilization. |
| 3 | **Potential.** The secret to happiness is to find one's place in the natural order and embrace it. |
| 4 | **Interdependence.** My role is deeply connected to the web of life, and my actions have consequences for everyone around me. |
| 5 | **Live and Let Live.** Ideals aren't worth killing or going to war for. |
| 6 | **History.** Only through studying the past can we avoid repeating past mistakes. |
