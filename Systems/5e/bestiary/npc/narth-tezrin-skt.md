# Narth Tezrin
*Source: Storm King's Thunder p. 254*  

Narth sells gear to adventurers, and he also has an adventurous spirit. The Lionshield Coster pays him well, but he longs to make a name for himself. At the same time, he runs a business with his partner Alaestra and knows she wouldn't forgive him if he ran off and never returned.

Ideal:"The bigger the risk, the greater the reward."

Bond:"I adore my colleague Alaestra, and I'd like to do something to impress her."

Flaw:"I'll risk life and limb to become a legend."
