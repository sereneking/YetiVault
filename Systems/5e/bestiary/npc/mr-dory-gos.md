# Mr. Dory
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 246*  

One of the four councillors who rule the Styes, Mr. Dory hides his cursed nature in plain sight. His rare, liquid-sensitive "skin condition" is actually a form of the same aboleth affliction that creates skum, though Dory's condition is not as severe, and he has managed to retain his free will.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** Mr. Dory has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Water Dependency.*** Mr. Dory takes 6 (`1d12`) acid damage at the end of every hour he goes without exposure to water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Mr. Dory's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (save DC 15, `+7` to hit with spell attacks). Mr. Dory can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only)

**1/day each**: [cloudkill](/Systems/5e/spells/cloudkill.md), [etherealness](/Systems/5e/spells/etherealness.md)

**2/day each**: [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md), [fireball](/Systems/5e/spells/fireball.md), [fly](/Systems/5e/spells/fly.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Mr. Dory makes three attacks with his rapier.

***Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) piercing damage and 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage.

***Eye of Corruption (Recharge 5-6).*** Mr. Dory glares at a creature he can see within 30 feet of him. The target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 27 (`5d10`) necrotic damage and 27 (`5d10`) poison damage and then gains vulnerability to both necrotic and poison damage for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half damage and does not gain the vulnerabilities.
