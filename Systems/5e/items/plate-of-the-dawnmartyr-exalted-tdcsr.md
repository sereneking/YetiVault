Beautiful silver scrollwork and priceless cut rubies adorn this set of brass-and-gold armor. Legend holds that it was worn by Duana, High Priest of the The Dawnfather, when she was martyred in the Battle of Ghor Dranas in the final days of the "Calamity". In more recent times, it was worn by [Pike Trickfoot](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/pike-trickfoot-tdcsr.md), a legendary cleric of the The Everlight, while fighting against "the Chroma Conclave" and The Whispered One.

## Dormant

While the Plate of the Dawnmartyr is in a dormant state, you gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing it. When a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to rebuke that creature, dealing it `1d6` fire damage.

## Awakened

When the Plate of the Dawnmartyr reaches an awakened state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor's bonus to AC increases to +2.  
- You are immune to the [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) condition.  
- You have resistance to fire damage.  
- The fire damage you deal when you rebuke an attacker increases to `2d6`.  

## Exalted

When the Plate of the Dawnmartyr reaches an exalted state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor's bonus to AC increases to +3.  
- When you rebuke an attacker, you can choose to deal either fire damage or radiant damage.  
- When you are reduced to 0 hit points, you can choose to have a blast of healing flame surround you. You regain 1 hit point and are lifted to your feet. Each enemy within 10 feet of you takes `2d6` fire damage or radiant damage (your choice). This property of the armor can't be used again until you finish a long rest.
