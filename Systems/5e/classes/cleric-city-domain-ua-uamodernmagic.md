# City Domain (UA)
*[Cleric](cleric.md): Divine Domain*  
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic p. 1*  


## Class Features

### City Domain (UA) (Level 1)

The City domain is concerned with the citizenry, commerce, traffic, and even architecture of modern civilization. In the eyes of a cleric of the city, the center of modern life is a sense and spirit of community, and the gravest enemies of the city are those who seek to harm the common weal of its citizens.

At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit.

Spells marked with an asterisk can be found in Unearthed Arcana: Modern Magic.

### Bonus Cantrip (Level 1)

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain the [on/off](/Systems/5e/spells/on-off-ua-uamodernmagic.md) cantrip in addition to your chosen cantrips.

### Bonus Proficiencies (Level 1)

Also starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with sidearms and proficiency with vehicles (land).

### Heart of the City (Level 1)

From 1st level, you are able to tap into the spirit of community found in the city. While you are within any city, you can gain advantage on a single Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception), [Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation), or [Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) check, and you are considered proficient in the appropriate skill. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Channel Divinity: Spirits of the City (Level 2)

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to call on the city for aid. As an action, you present your holy symbol, and any city utility within 30 feet of you either works perfectly or shuts down entirely for 1 minute (your choice).

Additionally, each hostile creature within 30 feet of you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) or [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) (your choice) by hazards such as entangling wires, high-pressure water erupting from fire hydrants, pavement collapsing to unseen potholes, and so on. A [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can escape by making a successful Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check against your spell save DC.

This effect is entirely local and affects only utilities within 30 feet of you. Determination of what utilities are available within range and how the physical effects of those utilities manifest are left to the DM.

### Block Watch (Level 6)

Starting at 6th level, your awareness while in the city extends preternaturally. While in an urban environment, you are considered proficient in the [Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight) and [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception) skills, and you add double your proficiency bonus to Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) and Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.

### Divine Strike (Level 8)

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with psychic energy borrowed from the citizens of your city. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra `1d8` psychic damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra psychic damage increases to `2d8`.

### Blessed Strikes (Level 8)
_Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 4_

*8th-level cleric Divine Domain feature (replaces Divine Strike)*

In battle, you are blessed with divine might. When a creature takes damage from one of your spells or weapon attacks, you can also deal `1d8` radiant damage to that creature. Once you deal this damage, you can't use this feature again until the start of your next turn.

### Express Transit (Level 17)

At 17th level, you can use mass transit routes to transport instantaneously to other points in the city. Starting from a bus stop, train station, subway stop, or other suitable mass transit site within the city, you can teleport to any other similar transit stop within the city, as if you had cast a [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md) spell whose destination is a permanent [teleportation circle](/Systems/5e/spells/teleportation-circle.md) you know. Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before using it again.
