**Prerequisite**: [Elf](/Systems/5e/races/elf.md)

You have the magical mark of Shadow, the dragonmark of House Phiarlan and House Thuranni, and are a member of one of those houses.

You gain the ability to innately cast spells and cantrips, using Charisma as your spellcasting ability. You cast each spell at its lowest level. Once you cast a given spell this way, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it innately again. You must still expend any material components.
