# Wolf-in-Sheep's-Clothing
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 221*  

A wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is a predatory plant that resembles a tree stump. It hides in areas of thick vegetation and has a bark-like hide, eyestalks like vines or withered flowers, rootlike tentacles, and a fleshy growth atop its body that it uses to lure prey toward its fang-filled maw.

Wolves-in-sheep's-clothing can reshape their lures to mimic the appearance of various small, often adorable creatures to entice their prey. The Lure Forms table suggests some forms the lure might take.

## Traits

***False Appearance.*** If the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is motionless (except for its lure) at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing move or act (except for the lure), that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Intelligence ([Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation)) check to discern that the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing is animate.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing makes one Bite attack and two Root Tentacle attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d8 + 5`) piercing damage plus 7 (`2d6`) acid damage.

***Root Tentacle.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d6 + 5`) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 16). While [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) in this way, the target has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition, and at the start of each of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing's turns, the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can pull the target up to 10 feet toward itself (no action required). The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing has four root tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

## Bonus Actions

***Completely Harmless Lure.*** The wolf-in-sheep's-clothing can change the color, texture, and shape of its lure to resemble a Tiny Beast or Tiny object. It can move the lure to reinforce the resemblance (no action required), but the lure must remain within 15 feet of the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing, connected by nearly [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) filament-like tendrils.
