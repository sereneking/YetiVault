# Darkweaver

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a darkweaver can take one of the following lair actions; the darkweaver can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Extinguish..** All nonmagical flames within 30 feet of the darkweaver are extinguished. In addition, if this area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.  
- **Shadow Fears..** The darkweaver instills frightful magic into its webs. Each creature grappled by the darkweaver's Shadow Web must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the frightened condition until the end of its next turn.  
- **Shadow Step..** If the darkweaver is in dim light or darkness, it teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet of itself that is in dim light or darkness.
