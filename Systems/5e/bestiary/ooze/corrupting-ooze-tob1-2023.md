# Corrupting Ooze
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 291*  

*The ooze boils and bubbles with rank marsh gas and the fetid stench of the sewer. It leaves a stinking trail of acidic slime wherever it goes.*

## Swim and Walk

A corrupting ooze is a festering slime that can slither and even swim like a gigantic sea slug, or it can assume a roughly humanoid form and shamble through the streets. Its stench and its lack of speech, however, make it unlikely that anyone might mistake it for a person. They are frequently soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and heralds of darkness.

## Dissolve Bones

A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large animal or small person, simply dissolving everything in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an important element of certain dark rituals.

## Strong Swimmer

A corrupting ooze naturally floats on the surface of water. It swims with a pulsating motion that propels it.

## Traits

***Ooze Nature.*** The ooze doesn't require sleep.

***Putrid Stench.*** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the corrupting ooze must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (`1d6`) poison damage and be [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) until the start of its next turn.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The corrupting ooze makes two Slam attacks. If both attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or one nonmagical leather, metal, or wooden item the creature is wearing or carrying is destroyed. This effect can't destroy armor or weapons.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`2d6`) poison damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Reshape Body.*** The corrupting ooze can reshape its mass into a vaguely Humanoid shape or back into its amorphous shape. It reverts to its amorphous shape if it dies. While in a Humanoid shape, it can take any action that requires hands, except it can't wield weapons or a shield or don armor.
