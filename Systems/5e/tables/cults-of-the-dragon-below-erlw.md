`dice: [](cults-of-the-dragon-below-erlw.md#^cults-of-the-dragon-below)`

| dice: d8 | Cult |
|----------|------|
| 1 | A cult of [Belashyrra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/belashyrra-erlw.md) murders innocents and steals their eyes, magically preserving the image of the last thing the eyes beheld. The cultists collect the eyes in a deep vault, while new eyes grow in strange places on their own bodies. |
| 2 | A cult of [Dyrrn the Corrupter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/dyrrn-erlw.md) seeks to transcend humanity by bonding with aberrations and symbionts. |
| 3 | A cult of Kyrzin, the daelkyr Prince of Slime, keeps a [gibbering mouther](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/gibbering-mouther.md) in the basement and feeds their elders to this creature, believing their voices can still be heard in the whispers of the beast. |
| 4 | A cult of [Rak Tulkhesh](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rak-tulkhesh-erlw.md) believes that this life is only a stepping stone, and members earn a path to paradise by spilling blood and spreading strife. |
| 5 | A cult of [Belashyrra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/belashyrra-erlw.md) serves a [beholder](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/beholder.md) messiah, believing that only the eye tyrant has the vision to lead them to a golden age. |
| 6 | A cult of [Dyrrn](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/dyrrn-erlw.md) led by a [mind flayer](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/mind-flayer.md) kidnaps people with dragonmarks, seeking to decipher the marks and transfer them to others. |
| 7 | An arcane think tank has become a cult of [Sul Khatesh](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/sul-khatesh-erlw.md); the members believe they can heal the damage of the Mourning, but the eldritch machine they are building will surely cause more horror. |
| 8 | A cult of [Rak Tulkhesh](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/rak-tulkhesh-erlw.md) has sprung up among a local militia. Its members are convinced that refugees from the war are secretly inhuman monsters, and must be destroyed. |
