# Deep One
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 72*  

*These fishlike folk have enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin.*

## Elder Gods

In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water darkness. In some areas, they intermarry with coastal humans to create human-deep one hybrids.

## Coastal Raiders

The deep ones keep to themselves in isolated coastal villages and settlements in the deep ocean for long periods, and then, at the command of their patron gods, turn suddenly into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or distant, chilled seas.

## Demand Sacrifices

They demand tolls from mariners frequently; those who do not leave tribute at certain islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets, or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their patient plans to dominate and rule.

## Ocean Change

A deep one born to a human family resembles a human child, but the person transforms into an adult deep one between the ages of 16 and 30. Such deep ones then hear the siren call of their elder god masters and oceanic cousins, which eventually supplants the love the person might feel for family and friends on land.

> [!note] Gods of the Deep Ones
> 
> The deep ones are faithful servants of horrific powers inimical to all life on land. Father Dagon is a god of fertility, fish, and the strength of the deep ocean and is an evil lord of storm and waves. Mother Hydra is his consort, a goddess of immense strength and size, spawning entire schools of fish at once. She is mistress of the great kraken and toothsome krake spawn, who are her children and servitors. Both deities plot conquest through a long program of forced interbreeding and eldritch meddling with human bloodlines.
> 
> In addition, many deep ones follow Shar-Ngolyeth, a long-lost deity referred to as That Which Lurks Beneath the Waves. This kraken and her krake spawn offspring are close allies to the deep ones, but they are largely indifferent to Dagon and Hydra.
