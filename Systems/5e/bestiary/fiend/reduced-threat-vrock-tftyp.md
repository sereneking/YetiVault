## Traits

***Reduced Threat.*** A reduced-threat monster takes a −2 penalty on attack rolls (included in the stat block), ability checks (included in the stat block for skill proficiencies), saving throws (included in the stat block for saving throw proficiencies), and saving throw DCs (included in the stat block).

***Magic Resistance.*** The vrock has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The vrock makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its talons.

***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d10 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Spores (Recharge 6).*** A 15-foot-radius cloud of toxic spores extends out from the vrock. The spores spread around corners. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned). While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a target takes 5 (`1d10`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect on it.

***Stunning Screech (1/Day).*** The vrock emits a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of it that can hear it and that isn't a demon must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the vrock's next turn.
