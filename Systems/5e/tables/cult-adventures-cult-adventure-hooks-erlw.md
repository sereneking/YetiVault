| dice: d8 | Adventure Hook |
|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Children throughout town begin reciting the same nursery rhyme, adding increasingly disturbing descriptions as the verses progress. No one knows where they learned the rhyme. |
| 2 | Shadows around the old asylum take on a deep, inky cast, and things move just outside the light. Then the whispered laughs begin. |
| 3 | A seemingly healthy noble dies of heart failure brought on by extreme terror, but with no clear source. The noble recently had an exquisite portrait painted. Every other person portrayed by the same artist has also died in a similar fashion. |
| 4 | In a remote village, the local herbalist is condemned for practicing dark magic against the villagers. They swear their innocence to the characters and beg to be exonerated before their scheduled execution. |
| 5 | Magic items begin exhibiting strange side effects, causing minor warping of their users' flesh, or fraying their users' sanity. |
| 6 | Strange bounty hunters stalk the characters, seemingly aware of all their secrets and loved ones. Odd lumps writhe beneath the hunters' cloaks. |
| 7 | A crazed hermit wanders into town and commits suicide in a grisly fashion. All the food in the village spoils instantly, and aberrant creatures attack every midnight thereafter. |
| 8 | Several caravans have gone missing over the course of months. The authorities hire mercenary help after an aberration attacks while wearing the signet ring of a missing caravan master. |
