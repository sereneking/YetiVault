# Sharpshooter (UA)
*[Fighter](fighter.md): Martial Archetype*  
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Fighter p. 3*  


## Class Features

### Sharpshooter (Level 3)

The Sharpshooter is a master of ranged combat. An excellent sniper and eagle-eyed scout, this fighter is a perilous foe who can defeat an entire war band so long as they are kept at range.

### Steady Aim (Level 3)

Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, your aim becomes deadly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can take careful aim at a creature you can see that is within range of a ranged weapon you're wielding. Until the end of this turn, your ranged attacks with that weapon gain two benefits against the target:

- The attacks ignore half and three-quarters cover.  
- On each hit, the weapon deals additional damage to the target equal to 2 + half your fighter level.  

You can use this feature three times. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Careful Eyes (Level 7)

Starting at 7th level, you excel at picking out hidden enemies and other threats. You can take the [Search](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Search) action as a bonus action.

You also gain proficiency in the [Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception), [Investigation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Investigation), or [Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival) skill (choose one).

### Close-Quarters Shooting (Level 10)

At 10th level, you learn to handle yourself in close combat. Making a ranged attack roll while within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose disadvantage on your roll.

In addition, if you hit a creature within 5 feet of you with a ranged attack on your turn, that creature can't take reactions until the end of this turn.

### Rapid Strike (Level 15)

Starting at 15th level, you learn to trade accuracy for swift strikes. If you have advantage on a weapon attack against a target on your turn, you can forgo that advantage to immediately make an additional weapon attack against the same target as a bonus action.

### Snap Shot (Level 18)

Starting at 18th level, you are ever ready to spring into action. If you take the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your first turn of a combat, you can make one additional ranged weapon attack as part of that action.
