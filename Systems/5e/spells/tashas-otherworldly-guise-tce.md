# Tasha's Otherworldly Guise
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, an object engraved with a symbol of the Outer Planes, worth at least 500 gp
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Uttering an incantation, you draw on the magic of the Lower Planes or Upper Planes (your choice) to transform yourself. You gain the following benefits until the spell ends:

- You are immune to fire and poison damage (Lower Planes) or radiant and necrotic damage (Upper Planes).  
- You are immune to the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition (Lower Planes) or the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) condition (Upper Planes).  
- Spectral wings appear on your back, giving you a flying speed of 40 feet.  
- You have a +2 bonus to AC.  
- All your weapon attacks are magical, and when you make a weapon attack, you can use your spellcasting ability modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.  
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that lets you attack more than once when you take the Attack action on your turn.  

**Classes**: [Cleric (Arcana Domain)](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric-arcana-domain-scag.md)
