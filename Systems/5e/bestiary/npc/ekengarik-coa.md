## Traits

***Hive Mind.*** All fiendish formians within 1 mile of Ekengarik can telepathically communicate with each other and Ekengarik.

***Regeneration.*** Ekengarik regenerates 10 hit points at the start of her turn, unless she took radiant damage in the last round.

***Spellcasting.*** Ekengarik casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18):

**At will**: [Detect Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md), [Dispel Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [Heroism](/Systems/5e/spells/heroism.md), [Magic Missile](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-missile.md)

**1/day each**: [Evard's Black Tentacles](/Systems/5e/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md), [Cone of Cold](/Systems/5e/spells/cone-of-cold.md), [Confusion](/Systems/5e/spells/confusion.md), [Dimension Door](/Systems/5e/spells/dimension-door.md), [Geas](/Systems/5e/spells/geas.md), [Invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md), [Prismatic Wall](/Systems/5e/spells/prismatic-wall.md), [Slow](/Systems/5e/spells/slow.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Ekengarik makes three Bite attacks. She can replace one of the attacks with an Acid Spray (if available) attack or a use of Spellcasting.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target's Strength score is reduced by 2 (`1d4`). The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

***Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** Ekengarik spits acid at one creature within 60 feet of her, or two creatures within 60 feet of her and 5 feet of each other. Targets must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (`6d10`) acid damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

## Reactions

***Hardened Carapace (Recharge 4-6).*** When hit with an attack, Ekengarik temporarily hardens her carapace, reducing her speed to 0 and increasing her AC by 5 until the start of her next turn.
