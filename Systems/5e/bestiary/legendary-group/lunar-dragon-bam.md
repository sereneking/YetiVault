# Lunar Dragon

## Regional effects


The region containing an ancient or adult lunar dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which produces one or more of the following effects:

- **Black Frost.** A thin layer of black frost covers the ground, which kills all ordinary plants growing within 6 miles of the lair if the dragon is ancient, or within 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.  
- **Haunting Moan.** A haunting sound gets louder or fainter (dragon's choice) the closer one gets to the lair. The moan is audible 6 miles from the lair if the dragon is ancient, or 3 miles if the dragon is an adult.  
- **Moon Devils.** Swirling funnels of dust and frost known as moon devils crisscross the area within 1 mile of the lair, intercepting other creatures they encounter. A moon devil is a free-willed air elemental that deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage.  

If the dragon dies, the moaning stops, the moon devils dissipate, and the black frost disappears over the course of `1d10` days, allowing plant life in the area to recover.
