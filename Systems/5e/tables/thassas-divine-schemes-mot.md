|----------|--------|
| 1 | After a kraken is sighted near an inhabited island, a fleet prepares to set sail from Meletis to face it. In retribution, Thassa pulls the ocean back from the entire coastline, stranding not only the fleet, but the fishing boats and merchant vessels that keep the polis fed and supplied. Thassa's oracles announce that "the forest of masts must be felled" before the waters will return, but Meletis refuses to give up its navy. How can Thassa be appeased? |
| 2 | During a divine conflict, one of the gods' weapons tumbles into the sea. Thassa refuses to return the godly weapon, claiming it as her own, much to the owner's ire. |
| 3 | Thassa turns a ship full of another god's champions into dolphins as punishment for setting foot on one of her holy isles. Can she be persuaded to change them back? How will the champions' patrons respond if she refuses? |
| 4 | When multiple gods turn against her in a dispute, Thassa is enraged. She releases the locks binding every kraken in the sea, along with that of an ancient and mysterious kraken brood mother. |
