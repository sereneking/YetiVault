# Decapus
*Source: The Tortle Package p. 21*  

Decapuses are carnivorous, solitary hunters that swing through trees, scooping up prey with their 10-foot-long, suckered tentacles. Decapuses also use their tentacles to climb walls and ceilings.

After securing a high vantage point, a decapus hangs by one tentacle and attacks with the other nine. On the ground, a decapus is slower and less dangerous. It must use half of its tentacles to support its weight upright, leaving five tentacles with which it can attack and defend itself.

## Marine Decapus

A marine decapus is similar to its land-dwelling cousin, except that it gains a swimming speed of 30 feet and can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The decapus makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tentacles.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the decapus. *Hit:* 7 (`2d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`9d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage or 14 (`5d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage if the decapus is grappling a creature other than the target or if the decapus is on the ground or floor. The target is also [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14) unless the decapus is already grappling a creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained).
