| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. |
| 2 | If you do me an injury, I will crush you, ruin your name, and salt your family's lands for all time. |
| 3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuable—or where such things might be hidden. |
| 4 | I get bitter if I'm not the center of attention. |
| 5 | I can't stand the dangerous idiots who deny their own needs in order to help others. It's often difficult to motivate them to do what I want. |
| 6 | If others won't do things when you ask nicely, stop asking nicely. |
| 7 | Inspiring fear can be the most effective way to motivate people. |
| 8 | I don't care about morality or taboos—only results. I'll do whatever it takes to get the results I want. |
