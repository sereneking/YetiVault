## Salvage

If defeated, the harvester's [coat of lies](/Systems/5e/items/coat-of-lies-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) can be claimed.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** Harvesters of lies can detect when a lie is uttered from 1 mile away. They are attracted to lies, the more frequent the lies and the more outlandish, the greater the attraction.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** Harvesters are resistant to nonmagical weapons and necrotic damage, and immune to poison.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** The harvester wears a coat made of the severed tongues of its victims that allow it to cast several spells.

## Traits

***Coat of Lies.*** While wearing their specially prepared coat, the harvester's AC is increase by 2 and it can use its innate spellcasting.

***Hear Lies.*** The harvester hears all lies uttered within 1 mile of it and knows the liar's distance and direction while the harvester choses to concentrate.

***Spider Climb.*** The harvester can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Trackless.*** The harvester leaves no tracks to indicate where it has been or where it's headed.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The harvester's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only that the harvester be wearing its coat of lies:

**At will**: [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md), [zone of truth](/Systems/5e/spells/zone-of-truth.md)

**1/day each**: [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md), [tongues](/Systems/5e/spells/tongues.md)

**3/day each**: [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md), [misty step](/Systems/5e/spells/misty-step.md), [silence](/Systems/5e/spells/silence.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The harvester makes three attacks, only one of which can be sever tongue.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 17).

***Sever Tongue.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one humanoid [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the harvester of lies. *Hit:* 33 (`8d6 + 5`) slashing damage and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have their tongue ripped out. A creature without a tongue cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a tongue, or has legendary actions.

A tongue can be reattached within 1 hour of being severed with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check, or at can be regrown using magic that replaces lost limbs.
