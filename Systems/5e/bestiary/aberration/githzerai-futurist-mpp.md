# Githzerai Futurist
*Source: Morte's Planar Parade p. 30, Sigil and the Outlands, Turn of Fortune's Wheel*  

Githzerai futurists have transcended their limits through focused meditation and can now catch glimpses of the future. They foresee the possible outcomes of battles, using those portents to tilt the balance in their favor.

## Githzerai

Githzerai descend from an ancient people who were also the progenitors of the githyankiâ€”all of whom were destroyed or transformed by mind flayers. Many githzerai dwell in Limbo, honing their psionic powers by shaping their homes on that chaotic plane. The githzerai described here oftentimes traverse the planes, crossing between them via the portals in Sigil and the Outlands. To learn more about other githzerai, see the*Monster Manual*.
