# Empty Cloak
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 164*  

*This dark cloth of black and purple, stitched with silver and golden threads, resembles a garment of elvish make. Smoke sometimes billows under the hood.*

## Silent Motion

A billowing empty cloak glides through the air, either under its own power or on the shoulders of its master. Its movement appears odd somehow, as though it moves slightly out of step with the frame bearing it.

## Guards

Created by the shadow fey as unobtrusive guardians, empty cloaks are often paired with animated armor or other constructs like monolith footmen, and made to look like a display piece.

## Shadow Servants

Shadow fey nobles sometimes wear an empty cloak as their own clothing, using it to cover a hasty retreat or to assist in a kidnapping.

## Traits

***Construct Nature.*** The empty cloak doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Diligent Sentinel.*** The empty cloak has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks.

***Shadow Construction.*** Made mostly of shadow, the empty cloak bursts into pieces then dissipates when a creature scores a critical hit against it.

***Wrapping Embrace.*** The empty cloak can occupy a Medium or smaller creature's space and vice versa. It has advantage on attack rolls against any creature in the same space as it.

## Actions

***Razor Cloak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d8 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Shadow Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft, one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Shadow Snare.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 20/60 ft., one Large or smaller creature. *Hit:* The target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by tendrils of shadow. A creature, including the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature, can take its action to free the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. The tendrils of shadow can be attack and destroyed (AC 12; hp 10; vulnerability to radiant damage; immunity to necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).

## Bonus Actions

***Protective Embrace.*** When a creature the cloak can see attacks a creature in the cloak's space, the cloak can briefly wrap itself around the creature in its space. The creature in its space takes only half the damage from the attack, and the cloak takes the other half.
