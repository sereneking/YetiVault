**Cavern Encounters**

`dice: [](cavern-encounters-llk.md#^cavern-encounters)`

| dice: d10 | Encounter |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | A [Xorn](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/xorn.md) and an [Umber Hulk](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/umber-hulk.md) hunt as a team, with the umber hulk working to herd characters toward its partner. Alternatively, the xorn and the umber hulk are rivals, with the characters caught in the middle. |
| 2 | A small war machine built at the monastery has been claimed by three kobolds, which use it to attack any potential threats. Use the statistics for the [Oaken Bolter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/clockwork-oaken-bolter-mpmm.md) (from "Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes") and the [Kobold Inventor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/kobold-inventor-mpmm.md) (from "Volo's Guide to Monsters"). |
| 3 | The characters' tunnel route leads through the lair of a [Froghemoth](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/froghemoth-mpmm.md) or some other exotic monstrosity escaped from another planar craft that crashed into the Barrier Peaks long ago. |
| 4 | A [Galeb Duhr](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md) serves as a kind of door between passageways. Negotiating with it successfully allows access to a secret tunnel that cuts days off the characters' journey. |
| 5 | Roving outlaws (five to ten [Thugs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/thug.md) led by a [Bandit Captain](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/bandit-captain.md)) heading to the monastery to join its ranks are hopelessly lost in the tunnels. In gratitude for being rescued, they offer to help the characters in their quest, but betray them at the first opportunity. |
| 6–7 | Six prisoners ([Commoners](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) escaping from the monastery look to the characters for aid. They are pursued by monks (five [Cultists](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) led by a [Cult Fanatic](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md)). If the prisoners are aided, they can supply some knowledge of the monastery before making their own way safely out of the mountains. |
| 8–10 | A monastery work party—six humanoid prisoners ([Commoners](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md)) watched by five [Cultists](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cultist.md) and a [Cult Fanatic](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/cult-fanatic.md)—is seen collecting ore to fuel the monastery's engines. If the prisoners are rescued, they can supply some knowledge of the monastery before fleeing the mountains. |
