# Armor of Magical Strength
*Source: UA2020SubclassesPt3 p. 3*  

**Prerequisite**: 10th-level

While wearing this armor, a creature can use its Intelligence modifier in place of its Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

The armor has 4 charges. As a reaction when it would be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), the wearer can expend 1 charge to not be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone). The armor regains `1d4` expended charges daily at dawn.
