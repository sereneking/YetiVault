When a dead god is left adrift in the Astral Sea, its corpse sometimes spawns a parasitic monster known as a hertilod. Voracious and terrifying, a hertilod resembles a skinless, serpentine lizard, with sharp claws and a gaping maw that drips venom. A hertilod's gruesomely exposed muscle renders it susceptible to lightning.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistances (3/Day).*** If the hertilod fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The hertilod has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Shock Susceptibility.*** If the hertilod takes lightning damage, its speed is halved until the end of its next turn, and it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or immediately regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the hertilod and has the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

***Spider Climb.*** The hertilod can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The hertilod makes one Bite attack and two Claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) piercing damage plus 13 (`2d12`) poison damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the hertilod. A swallowed creature has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) conditions, and it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hertilod. At the start of each of the hertilod's turns, each swallowed creature takes 13 (`2d12`) poison damage from the poisonous secretion in the hertilod's gullet.

The hertilod's gullet can hold up to two creatures at a time. If the hertilod takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the hertilod must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, each of which lands in a space within 10 feet of the hertilod and has the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition. If the hertilod dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting with the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+12` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) slashing damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Sprint.*** The hertilod moves up to its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

***Feed (Costs 2 Actions).*** The hertilod drains life from the creatures in its gullet to bolster itself. Each creature in the hertilod's gullet takes 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage, and the hertilod regains a number of hit points equal to the damage.
