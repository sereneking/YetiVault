# Thessalkraken

## Lair actions
_Source: Infernal Machine Rebuild_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the thessalkraken takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:

- A strong current moves through the thessalkraken's lair. Each creature within 60 feet of the thessalkraken must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the thessalkraken. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the thessalkraken.  
- Creatures in the water within 60 feet of the thessalkraken have vulnerability to acid damage until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- The alluring gleam of treasure beneath the water in the thessalkraken's lair compels potential victims to draw near. Each creature within 120 feet of the thessalkraken must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or move 10 feet closer to the thessalkraken if able to do so.
