# Pit Fighting
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Downtime p. 10* 

This downtime activity covers boxing, wrestling, and other nonlethal forms of combat. If you want to introduce an arena with battles to the death, use standard combat rules.

## Resources

This activity requires one workweek of effort from a character.

Resolution The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the opposition that the character runs into. The challenge in pit fighting lies in the mystery of your opponents.

The character makes three checks: Strength ([Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics)), Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)), and Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)). The DC is 5` + 2d10`, generating a separate DC for each check. Consult the Pit Fighting Results table to see how the character does.

| 1 success | Win 50 gp. |

## Complications
