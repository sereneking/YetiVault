# Nihileth Aboleth

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nihileth can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the nihileth can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Open the Void.** Up to three points in water the nihileth can see within 90 feet of it become conduits to the Void. Each creature within 10 feet of a point must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage.  
- **Void Absorbance.** The nihileth can pull the life force from nearby nihilethic zombies and dominators to replenish its own life. Nihilethic dominators and zombies within 30 feet of the nihileth take a total of 21 (`6d6`) psychic damage, divided evenly between them, and the nihileth regains hp equal to that amount. If a zombie or dominator is reduced to 0 hp from this damage, it is destroyed.  
- **Void Shuffle.** The nihileth calls on the power of the Void within its lair to rearrange its servitors. The nihileth can teleport each nihilethic dominator and zombie it can see within 60 feet of it to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the target's starting location.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a nihileth's lair is corrupted by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Befouled Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of a nihileth's lair are not only supernaturally fouled but can spread the nihileth's disease. A creature that drinks such water must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the*nihilethic rot*disease (see the Nihilethic Rot trait).  
- **Thinned Veil.** The veil between the Material Plane and the Void is thinner within 1 mile of the nihileth's lair. Beasts born or hatched in the area often have additional vestigial limbs, protoeyes, black or sludge-like blood, or similar signs of the corrupting influence of the Void.
