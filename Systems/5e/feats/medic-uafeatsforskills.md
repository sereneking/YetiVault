# Medic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Skills p. 2*  

You master the physician's arts, gaining the following benefits:

- You gain proficiency in the [Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine) skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it.  
- During a short rest, you can clean and bind the wounds of up to six willing beasts and humanoids. Make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) check for each creature. On a success, if a creature spends a Hit Die during this rest, that creature can forgo the roll and instead regain the maximum number of hit points the die can restore. A creature can do so only once per rest, regardless of how many Hit Dice it spends.
