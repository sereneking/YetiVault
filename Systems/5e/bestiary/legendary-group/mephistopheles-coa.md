# Mephistopheles

## Regional effects
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

The region containing Mephistopheles' lair is corrupted by his presence, which creates the following effect:

- **Geysers.** Within 1 mile of Mephistopheles' lair, every 100 feet of movement results in a flame geyser erupting. Creatures within 10 feet of a geyser when it erupts must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`3d6`) fire damage. The geyser continues erupting for 24 hours.  

If Mephistopheles dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.

## Lair actions
_Source: Chains of Asmodeus_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Mephistopheles can take one lair action to cause the following effect or one from the archdevil lair action list (page 214); he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Conjure Hellfire.** Mephistopheles covers a 5-foot square with Hellfire. Any creature that starts their turn in the Hellfire takes 27 (`6d8`) fire damage. The Hellfire remains until Mephistopheles dismisses it.  

- **Attack.** The archdevil uses one of their available melee or ranged attacks against a single foe.  
- **Cast a Spell.** The archdevil uses their Spellcasting feature to cast an available spell. If the spell normally requires [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), it lasts for the full duration instead.  
- **Deceitful Whispers.** The archdevil whispers to a creature they can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the charmed condition until the start of their next turn and must use their reaction immediately to make an attack against one of the archdevil's enemies, chosen by the archdevil.  
- **Fiendish Fortitude.** The archdevil recharges one of their expended abilities.  
- **Frenzy.** The archdevil casts [Haste](/Systems/5e/spells/haste.md) on themself. The effect ends at initiative count 20 of the next round.  
- **Summon Underlings.** The archdevil summons allied devils. The devils summoned depends on the archdevil using this feature. The summoned devils appear in unoccupied spaces which the archdevil can see. The [Summoned Underlings](/Systems/5e/tables/archdevil-lair-action-list-summoned-underlings-coa.md) table shows which devils each archdevil can summon.  
- **Teleport.** The archdevil teleports themself to an area they can see within 120 feet.  
- **Trap.** The archdevil casts the [Hold Monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md) spell.
