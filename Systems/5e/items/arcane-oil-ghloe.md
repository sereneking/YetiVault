# Arcane Oil
*Potion, rare*  


This substance is created by distilling the jelly that encases the brain of a [xakalonus](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/xakalonus-ghloe.md). As an action, you can coat one weapon or 20 pieces of ammunition with the substance.

If the coated objects are not magical, for the next minute, your attacks with the coated weapon or ammunition gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

If the coated objects are magical, the oil does not affect attack or damage rolls with them. However, your attacks against the [hraptnon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/hraptnon-ghloe.md) can fully damage that creature for one minute.
