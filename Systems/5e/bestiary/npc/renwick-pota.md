## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If Renwick fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Turn Resistance.*** Renwick has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Legendary Actions

***Cantrip.*** Renwick casts a cantrip.

***Paralyzing Touch (Costs 2 Actions).*** Renwick uses its Paralyzing Touch.

***Frightening Gaze (Costs 2 Actions).*** Renwick fixes its gaze on one creature it can see within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. The [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to Renwick's gaze for the next 24 hours.

***Disrupt Life (Costs 3 Actions).*** Each non-undead creature within 20 feet of Renwick must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw against this magic, taking 21 (`6d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
