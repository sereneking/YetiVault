# Eyes of the Impossible
*Charm*  

You are scarred by knowledge you shouldn't possess. Your eyes turn black, except for your pupils, which turn white. This charm grants you advantage on Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks made to interact with evil creatures. Additionally, you can cast the spell [eyebite](/Systems/5e/spells/eyebite.md) as an action. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (your choice when you gain this charm). Once you cast this spell, you can't cast it again until the next dawn. This charm vanishes after 13 days, when your appearance returns to normal.
