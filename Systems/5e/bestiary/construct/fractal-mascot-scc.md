# Fractal Mascot
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 192*  

To an untrained eye, a fractal mascot looks like a creature made from facets of hard light. But arithmancers know that these fractals are actually living equations: artificial life forms created by extrapolating magic from the mathematical patterns in nature.

Because of their arithmetic basis, fractal mascots can alter both their size and density. Quandrix College has adopted the fractal as its mascot, and many a Quandrix student can be found playing fetch with a fractal companion in between lessons.

## Traits

***Relative Density.*** The fractal can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions

***Quantum Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d4 + 1`) force damage, or 6 (`2d4 + 1`) force damage if the fractal is Medium or bigger.

## Bonus Actions

***Augment.*** The fractal's size increases by one category. While the fractal is Medium or bigger, it makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. The fractal can become no larger than Huge via this bonus action.

***Diminish.*** The fractal's size decreases by one category. While the fractal is Tiny, it makes attack rolls, Dexterity checks, and Dexterity saving throws with advantage. The fractal can become no smaller than 1 foot in height via this bonus action.
