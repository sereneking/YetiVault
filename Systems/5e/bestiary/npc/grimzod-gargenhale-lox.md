## Traits

***Explode.*** When Grimzod is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes in a cloud of ash. Any creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) necrotic damage.

***Spider Climb.*** Grimzod can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Unusual Nature.*** Grimzod doesn't require air or drink.

## Actions

***Energy Drain.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage. A Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points by this attack dies and instantly transforms into a free-willed shadow or vampirate (captain's choice) under the DM's control.

***Heavy Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d10 + 3`) piercing damage.

***Ship Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** A ship upon which Grimzod stands, along with all creatures and objects aboard it, becomes [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) to creatures not aboard the ship. Grimzod must concentrate on this magical effect to maintain it (as if concentrating on a spell), and it lasts for up to 1 hour. The effect ends if Grimzod leaves the ship.

## Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** Grimzod halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. Grimzod must be able to see the attacker.
