# Soluun Xibrindas
*Source: Waterdeep: Dragon Heist p. 202*  

Soluun is a sadistic, fanatical bully who is fiercely loyal to Bregan D'aerthe, and to Jarlaxle in particular. His younger brother, Nar'l, has infiltrated the Xanathar Guild. Soluun considers Nar'l a weakling who turned to arcane magic by way of compensation, and he has never had much faith in his brother or his abilities.

Soluun has a burning hatred of surface elves and halfelves, having been taught from a young age to kill them as opportunity permits. When not engaged in a Bregan D'aerthe operation, Soluun spends his nights haunting the darkened streets and alleys of Waterdeep, looking for solitary elves or half-elves to pick off. He conceals his nighttime escapades as well as he can, but Jarlaxle, Fel'rekt, and Krebbyg know what he's up to.

## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** Soluun has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put Soluun to sleep.

***Gunslinger.*** Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature or attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on Soluun's ranged attack rolls with a pistol. In addition, Soluun ignores half cover and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks with a pistol.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Soluun has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Equipment.*** Four packets of smokepowder and a pouch containing 20 pistol bullets

***Boots of Elvenkind.*** Whilst wearing these boots Soluun's steps make no sound and he has advantage on any Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on moving silently.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Soluun's spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [dancing lights](/Systems/5e/spells/dancing-lights.md)

**1/day each**: [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [faerie fire](/Systems/5e/spells/faerie-fire.md), [levitate](/Systems/5e/spells/levitate.md) (self only)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Soluun makes two scimitar attacks.

***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d6 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Poisonous Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+6` to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`1d10 + 4`) piercing damage plus 11 (`2d10`) poison damage.
