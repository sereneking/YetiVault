# Storm Giant Quintessent

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

A storm giant quintessent can use lair actions in giant form and while transformed into a storm. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the giant can take one of the following lair actions; the giant can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Deafening Boom.** The giant creates a thunderclap centered on a point anywhere in their lair. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened) until the end of its next turn.  
- **Fog.** The giant creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog (or murky water if within water) centered on a point anywhere in its lair. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The fog lasts until the giant disperses it (no action required), and it can't be dispersed by wind.  
- **Gale.** The giant creates a 60-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line of strong wind (or strong current within water) originating from a point anywhere in its lair. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet in the direction the wind is blowing. The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in its area. Protected flames, such as those of lanterns, have a 50% chance chance of being extinguished.  

## Regional effects

The region containing a storm giant quintessent's lair is warped by the giant's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Downpour.** Rain, snow, or blowing dust or sand (whichever is most appropriate) is constant within 1 mile of the lair. Rain causes rivers and streams to fill or overflow their banks; snow, dust, or sand forms deep drifts or dunes.  
- **Lightning.** Flashes of lightning and peals of thunder are continual, day and night, within 5 miles of the lair.  
- **Winds.** High wind blows within 1 mile of the lair, making it impossible to light a fire unless the location where the fire is lit is protected from the wind.  

If the giant dies, the lightning, thunder, and high wind regional effects end immediately. Rain, snow, and blowing dust abate gradually within `1d8` days.
