# Riverine

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the riverine can take one of the following lair actions; the riverine can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Phantasmal Mist.** The riverine creates fog around a creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (`1d10`) psychic damage and be [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of the riverine until the end of the target's next turn.  
- **River's Fury.** The riverine conjures swampy ground that briefly covers the ground in a 20-foot square the riverine can see within 120 feet of itself. That area becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 on the next round. Any creature, other than the riverine, that enters the affected area or starts its turn there takes 7 (`2d6`) cold damage.  

## Regional effects


The region containing a riverine's lair flourishes under the magic of the riverine's presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Clearwater Sight.** The waters of the river serve as a conduit for the riverine's consciousness. As an action, the riverine can cast the [clairvoyance](/Systems/5e/spells/clairvoyance.md) spell, requiring no spell components, targeting any point along the river it's connected to.  
- **River's Bounty.** Freshwater fauna and flora reproduce rapidly and thrive in the waters within 1 mile of the riverine's lair. Foraging in these waters yields twice the usual amount of food.  
- **Spirit Guidance.** Tracks appear along the banks of the river within 6 miles of the riverine's lair. The tracks lead to potential shelters and safe passages across the river's waters, while also leading away from areas that the riverine prefers to remain undisturbed.  

If the riverine dies, the flora and fauna return to normal levels, and its river dries out over the course of `1d10` days. All other effects cease immediately.
