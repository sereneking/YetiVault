# Investment of the Chain Master
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Class Feature Variants p. 11*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Chain

When you cast find familiar, you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits:

- The familiar gains either a flying speed or a swimming speed (your choice) of 40 feet.  
- The familiar no longer needs to breathe.  
- The familiar's weapon attacks are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming immunity and resistance to nonmagical attacks.  
- If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.
