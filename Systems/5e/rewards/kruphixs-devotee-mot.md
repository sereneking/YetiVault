# Kruphix's Devotee
*Piety Trait*  

*Piety 3+ Kruphix trait*

As a devotee of Kruphix, you have proven yourself a devotee of reality's mysteries and laws. You can cast [detect magic](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-magic.md) with this trait a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

In addition, you know the [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md) cantrip. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
