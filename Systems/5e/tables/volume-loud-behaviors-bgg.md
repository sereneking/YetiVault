| 2 | The giant's thoughtful "hmm" causes a rumbling vibration in the ground and the pit of listeners' stomachs. |
| 3 | The giant's exclamation of surprise or anger briefly sets listeners' ears ringing. |
| 4 | The giant's sneeze, snore, or sigh rattles windows or blows leaves off trees. |
| 5 | The giant's laughter feels like a small earthquake. |
| 6 | The giant's armor or weapons clang thunderously. |
