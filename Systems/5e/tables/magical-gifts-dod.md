**Magical Gifts**

`dice: [](magical-gifts-dod.md#^magical-gifts)`

| dice: d8 | Gift |
|----------|------|
| 1 | **Charm.** The archfey bestows a charm of the DM's choice (see "Supernatural Gifts" in the Dungeon Master's Guide). |
| 2 | **Guide.** The archfey summons a magical guide that takes the form of a faerie dragon, a sprite, or some other creature. The guide is a harmless figment that can't be damaged, and it knows its way around the Feywild. It can't leave the Feywild and disappears after eight days. |
| 3 | **Lore.** With a touch, the archfey magically imparts useful knowledge about a particular subject of the archfey's choice. This knowledge might be permanent, or it might fade over time. |
| 4 | Magic **Item.** The archfey bestows a useful magic item (such as a crystal ball or an oathbow) but warns that the item will vanish after a specified period of time, which it does. |
| 5 | **Refuge.** The archfey creates a wooded glen, a dome of brambles, a silken cocoon, or some other kind of refuge. Creatures hostile toward the gift's recipient can't enter this refuge without the recipient's consent. After a specified period of time, the refuge vanishes. |
| 6 | **Resurrection.** The archfey offers one free casting of the [true resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/true-resurrection.md) spell, which they can cast as an action without material components once per century. |
| 7 | **Training.** With a touch, the archfey grants the benefit of months of special training (see "Marks of Prestige" in the Dungeon Master's Guide for different benefits of training). |
| 8 | **Transformation.** The archfey offers one free casting of the [true polymorph](/Systems/5e/spells/true-polymorph.md) spell, which they can cast without material components. The spell's effect can be made permanent, if you wish. |
