# J'ba Fofi Spider
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 344*  

*A large, brown spider that resembles a tarantula with exaggeratedly long legs gracefully emerges from the bushes, followed by similar arachnids that are smaller and yellow in color.*

The j'ba fofi resembles an oversized tarantula with very long legs, although a flicker of intelligence indicates this species evolved above mere vermin.

## Spider Pack Leaders

The youngest are yellow in color, but their hairs turn brown as they age. Immature j'ba fofi pull ordinary spiders into their fellowship in teeming masses that follow along wherever they roam.

## Fond of Camouflage

The natural coloring of a j'ba fofi, along with its habit to cover its hair-like bristles in a layer of leaves makes it virtually invisible in its natural environment. They weave leaves and other forest litter into their webs to create well-hidden, enclosed lairs.

## Traits

***Camouflaged Webs.*** With 10 minutes of work, the j'ba fofi can create a camouflaged web in a 10-foot cube. The web must be anchored between two solid mases or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling. A camouflaged web layered over a flat surface has a depth of 5 feet. The web is camouflaged to match its surroundings, requiring a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to notice them. Each creature that starts its turn in the camouflaged web or that enters it during the creature's turn must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained). A creature, including the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature, can take its action to break the webbing and free the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature by succeeding on a DC 13 Strength check. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10; hp 5; vulnerability to fire damage; immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).

***Forest Camouflage.*** The j'ba fofi has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in forested terrain.

***Spider Climb.*** The j'ba fofi can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Spider Passivism.*** No spider can willingly attack the j'ba fofi, unless attacked first. A spider can be forced to do so through magical means.

***Web Sense.*** While in contact with a web, the j'ba fofi knows the exact location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

***Web Walker.*** The j'ba fofi ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hp, the target is stable but [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for 1 hour, even after regaining hp, and is [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) while [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way.

***Call Spiderlings (1/Day).*** The j'ba fofi releases pheromones and calls 1 swarm of spiders. The spiders arrive in `1d4` rounds, acting as allies of the j'ba fofi and obeying its pheromone commands. The spiders remain for 1 hour, until the j'ba fofi dies, or until the j'ba fofi dismisses them as a bonus action.
