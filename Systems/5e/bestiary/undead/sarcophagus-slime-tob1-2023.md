# Sarcophagus Slime
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 316*  

*The sarcophagus opens to reveal an eerie, scintillating light. Wisps of gelid amber ectoplasm undulate outward from a quivering mass with a blackened skull at its center.*

## Vigilant Slime

Sarcophagus slimes are amorphous undead guardians placed in the tombs of the powerful to guard them and to wreak terrible vengeance on would-be defilers of the ancient crypts. The slimes seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.

## Muddled Origins

Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.

## Death to Tomb Robbers

These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.

## Traits

***Amorphous.*** The sarcophagus slime can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Undead Nature.*** The sarcophagus slime doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sarcophagus slime can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes two Slam attacks. It can replace one Slam attack with a use of Corrupting Gaze.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`2d6 + 2`) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`2d8`) acid damage.

***Corrupting Gaze.*** One creature the sarcophagus slime can see within 30 feet of it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. A Humanoid slain by this effect rises 24 hours later as a sarcophagus slime, unless the Humanoid is restored to life or its body is destroyed.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the sarcophagus slime's choice that is within 60 feet of the sarcophagus slime and aware of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sarcophagus slime's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
