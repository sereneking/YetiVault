# Players Make All Rolls
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Variant Rules p. 1* 

This variant has the players roll dice for all parts of combat, including such things as monster attack rolls and saving throws. By moving die rolls to the players' side of the table, this option keeps things simpler for you as the DM. In addition, the more active you can keep the players in your game, the more engaged they'll be.

This is a good option if your players like rolling the dice, and if you don't mind doing a little work up front to make that happen.

## Attacking and Defending

The players roll their characters' attacks as normal, but you don't roll for their opponents. Instead, when a character is targeted by an attack, the player makes a defense roll.

A defense roll has a bonus equal to the character's AC - 10. The DC for the roll equals the attacker's attack bonus + 11.

On a successful defense roll, the attack misses because it was dodged, absorbed by the character's armor, and so on. If a character fails a defense roll, the attack hits.

If the attacker would normally have advantage on the attack roll, you instead apply disadvantage to the defense roll, and vice versa if the attacker would have disadvantage.

If the defense roll comes up as a 1 on the `d20`, then the attack is a critical hit. If the attacker would normally score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, then the attack is a critical hit on a 1 or 2, and so forth for broader critical ranges.

## Saving Throws

When a character forces an opponent to make a saving throw, that player instead makes a saving throw check. The bonus to the `d20` roll for a saving throw check equals the effect's save DC -8.

The DC for this check equals 11 + the target's saving throw modifier. On a successful check, the character overcomes the target's resistance and treats the target as if it failed its saving throw. On a failed check, the target is treated as if it succeeded on its save.

As with attacks, the saving throw check has advantage if the target would have disadvantage on its saving throw, and vice versa.

## Contests and Checks

Whenever an NPC or monster would normally make an ability check, roll initiative, or take part in a contest, neither you nor the players roll the `d20`. Instead, use the rules for passive checks to determine the result. See chapter 7, ""Using Ability Scores"," of the "Player's Handbook" for more information on passive checks.
