# Fraz-Urb'luu

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), FrazUrb'luu can take one of the following lair actions when in his lair; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Conjure Walls and Doors.** Fraz-Urb'luu causes up to five doors within the lair to become walls and an equal number of doors to appear on walls where there previously were none.  
- **Psychic Anguish.** Fraz-Urb'luu creates a wave of anguish. Each creature he can see within the lair must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (`6d10`) psychic damage.  
- **Simulacrum.** Fraz-Urb'luu chooses one Humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the [simulacrum](/Systems/5e/spells/simulacrum.md) spell). This simulacrum obeys Fraz-Urb'luu's commands and is destroyed on the next initiative count 20.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Fraz-Urb'luu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Beguiling Realm.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) and Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks have disadvantage, and all Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Charisma ([Performance](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Performance)) checks have advantage.  
- **Nostalgic Pangs.** Sapient creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse.  
- **Twisted Paths.** Roads and paths within 6 miles of the lair twist and turn back on themselves, making navigation in the area exceedingly difficult.  

If Fraz-Urb'luu dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
