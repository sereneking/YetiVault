|----------|----------------|
| 1 | A disguised dragon requests assistance repairing a damaged orrery within the observatory. |
| 2 | One of the character's contacts is secretly the servant of a Chamber dragon observer. When the contact goes missing, their notes point toward a hidden "library" in the mountains. |
| 3 | The planar observatory might offer a way to prevent or at least predict what seems to be an epidemic of destructive manifest zones. |
| 4 | An observatory has been taken over by demonic cultists, and the characters must reclaim the facility or destroy it before the cult makes use of it. |
| 5 | A dragonmarked character has recurring nightmares that lead them to the observatory. |
| 6 | A thief or assassin has been using a derelict observatory as a hideout, occasionally selling bits of the observatory's dragonshards and equipment. |
| 7 | A scholar hires the characters to assist with studying and restoring a rediscovered observatory. |
| 8 | Several observatories across the region will produce a powerful effect if each is brought into a specific, simultaneous alignment. |
