# Keenness of the Stone Giant
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

You've manifested the protection and spellcasting emblematic of stone giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Dreamer's Magic.** You learn the [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the abjuration or the divination school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for this feature (choose when you gain this feat).  
- **Mountain Sight.** You gain [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision) from another source, its range increases by 30 feet.
