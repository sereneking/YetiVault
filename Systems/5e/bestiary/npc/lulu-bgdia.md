## Traits

***Aura of Invulnerability.*** An [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) aura forms a 10-foot-radius sphere around Lulu for as long as it lives. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells. Lulu can use an action to suppress this trait until its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) ends (as if concentrating on a spell).

***Magic Weapons.*** Lulu's weapon attacks are magical.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Lulu's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 15). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [light](/Systems/5e/spells/light.md)

**1/day each**: [banishment](/Systems/5e/spells/banishment.md), [heal](/Systems/5e/spells/heal.md), [raise dead](/Systems/5e/spells/raise-dead.md), [shapechange](/Systems/5e/spells/shapechange.md) (into a golden-furred [mammoth](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/mammoth.md) with feathered wings and a flying speed of 120 ft.), [teleport](/Systems/5e/spells/teleport.md) (with no chance of error)

**2/day each**: [bless](/Systems/5e/spells/bless.md), [cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md), [protection from evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good.md)

## Actions

***Tusks.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d6`) piercing damage.

***Trumpet (3/Day).*** Lulu blows air through its trunk, creating a trumpet sound that can be heard out to a range of 600 feet. The trumpet also creates a 30-foot cone of energy that has one of the following effects, chosen by Lulu:

***Trumpet of Blasting.*** Each creature in the cone must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 (`5d6`) thunder damage and is [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [deafened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#deafened). Nonmagical objects in the cone that aren't being held or worn take 35 (`10d6`) thunder damage.

***Trumpet of Sparkles.*** Creatures in the cone must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (`4d8 + 4`) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Evil creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw. Good creatures in the cone take no damage.
