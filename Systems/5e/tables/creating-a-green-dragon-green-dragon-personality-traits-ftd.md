**Green Dragon Personality Traits**

| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | You're either with me or you're against me. Just kidding—you're lunch either way! |
| 2 | I hate how much people think they matter in a world that was old before their kind even learned the idea of names. |
| 3 | The more the merrier as far as I'm concerned: more to control, more to torture, more to feast upon when I'm finally bored. |
| 4 | Bipedal life is too ugly and ignorant to merit even a scrap of compassion. |
| 5 | I like seeing life through the eyes of a lesser being—before forcing that creature to gouge their eyes out. |
| 6 | The wilds are mine and mine alone, and anyone who thinks they can enter my territory had best hope I have other distractions that day. |
| 7 | I allow others to dwell in my forest—if they act as my eyes, ears, and occasional playthings in return. |
| 8 | I harbor no animosity toward anyone. Let me grow ancient with my forest, and I'll leave you in peace. |
