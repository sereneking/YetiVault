# Encode Thoughts
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*cantrip, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** 8 hour

Putting a finger to your head, you pull a memory, an idea, or a message from your mind and transform it into a tangible string of glowing energy called a thought strand, which persists for the duration or until you cast this spell again. The thought strand appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you as a Tiny, weightless, semisolid object that can be held and carried like a ribbon. It is otherwise stationary.

If you cast this spell while concentrating on a spell or an ability that allows you to read or manipulate the thoughts of others (such as [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) or [modify memory](/Systems/5e/spells/modify-memory.md)), you can transform the thoughts or memories you read, rather than your own, into a thought strand.

Casting this spell while holding a thought strand allows you to instantly receive whatever memory, idea, or message the thought strand contains. (Casting [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) on the strand has the same effect.)
