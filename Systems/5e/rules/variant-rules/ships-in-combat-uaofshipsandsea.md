# Ships in Combat
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Of Ships and the Sea p. 8* 

This section provides guidance on using ships in combat.

## Ships and Initiative

A ship rolls initiative using its Dexterity, and it uses its crew's quality score as a modifier to that roll.

On a ship's turn, the captain decides which of the ship's actions to use.

## Special Officer Actions

During an encounter, the captain, first mate, and bosun each have access to two special action options described below: Full Speed Ahead and Fire at Will.

### Full Speed Ahead

As an action while on deck, the captain, first mate, or bosun can exhort the crew to work harder and drive a ship forward. Roll a `d6` and multiply the result by 5. Apply the total as a bonus to the ship's speed until the end of the ship's next turn. If this bonus is applied to a ship's speed when the ship is already moving faster than normal, use the higher result. Don't add the two bonuses together.

### Fire at Will

As an action, the captain, first mate, or bosun aids the crew in aiming one of the ship's weapons. Select one of the ship's weapons that is within 10 feet of the officer. It gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of the ship's next turn.
