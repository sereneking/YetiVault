# Rust Drake
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 145*  

*This rust-covered dragon could easily be mistaken for a pile of scrap metal.*

## Shedding Rust

Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes, this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of flakes.

## Warped Metallics

Many sages claim that rust dragons are a perversion of nature's order obtained either by the corruption of a metallic dragon's egg or the transformation of such a dragon by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth about their origins.

## Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters

These foul creatures feed on rust and are known as disease carriers.

## Traits

***Rust Drake Lockjaw.*** A creature infected with this disease manifests symptoms `1d4` days after infection, which include painful muscle spasms, particularly in the jaw. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [paralyzed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed) for 1 hour and have its Dexterity score reduced by `1d4`. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws recovers from the disease.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drake makes one Bite attack and two Tail Swipe attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`3d8 + 5`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution save or contract the rust drake lockjaw disease (see the Rust Drake Lockjaw trait).

***Tail Swipe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+8` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`2d8 + 5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Vomit Scrap (Recharge 5-6).*** The rust drake vomits forth a 15-foot cone of rusted metal. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (`5d8`) slashing damage and 22 (`5d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, each creature that failed the saving throw must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or contract the rust drake lockjaw disease (see the Rust Drake Lockjaw trait).
