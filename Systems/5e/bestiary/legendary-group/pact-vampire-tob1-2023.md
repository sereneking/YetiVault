# Pact Vampire

## Regional effects


The region containing a pact vampire's lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects.

- **Hemophilia.** Creatures bleed more easily within 3 miles of the lair, causing even the slightest scratch to bleed a little longer than usual.  
- **Overcast Skies.** The area within 6 miles of the lair is perpetually overcast with bits of moonlight peeking through the thick clouds on nights important to the vampire or its patron.  
- **Thinned Veil.** The veil between the Material Plane within 1 mile of the lair and the vampire's patron's home plane is thinned. Conjuration spells that pull from the patron's home plane are more potent and last longer, and planar travel between the Material Plane and the patron's home plane is easier.  

If the pact vampire dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
