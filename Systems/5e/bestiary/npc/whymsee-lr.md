## Traits

***Amphibious.*** Whymsee can breathe air and water.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Whymsee's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13, `+5` to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [command](/Systems/5e/spells/command.md), [create or destroy water](/Systems/5e/spells/create-or-destroy-water.md)

**1/day each**: [lightning bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/lightning-bolt.md), [Evard's black tentacles](/Systems/5e/spells/evards-black-tentacles.md)

**3/day each**: [control water](/Systems/5e/spells/control-water.md), [darkness](/Systems/5e/spells/darkness.md), [water breathing](/Systems/5e/spells/water-breathing.md), [water walk](/Systems/5e/spells/water-walk.md)

## Actions

***Thunderous Touch.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 27 (`5d10`) thunder damage.

***Ink Cloud.*** While underwater, Whymsee can expel an ink cloud in a 20-foot radius. The cloud spreads around corners, and that area is heavily obscured to creatures other than kraken priests or a kraken. Each creature other than a kraken priest or a kraken that ends its turn there must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (`2d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A strong current disperses the cloud, which otherwise disappears at the end of Whymsee's next turn.

***Shell Defense.*** Whymsee withdraws into her shell. Until she emerges, she gains a +4 bonus to AC and has advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While in her shell, Whymsee is [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone), her speed is 0 and can't increase, she has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, it can't take reactions, and the only action she can take is a bonus action to emerge.
