**Ancient Black Dragon Connections**

`dice: [](connected-creatures-ancient-black-dragon-connections-ftd.md#^ancient-black-dragon-connections)`

| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | An [ancient black dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md), after studying blasphemous texts dedicated to alien gods, issues a warning that a corrupted [planetar](/Systems/5e/bestiary/celestial/planetar.md) will soon fall to earth like a meteor in the fens outside a great city's walls. |
| 2 | An illithid community has spent nearly a millennium raising and preparing a black dragon to become an [elder brain dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/elder-brain-dragon-ftd.md) (described in "chapter 6"), so the [elder brain](/Systems/5e/bestiary/aberration/elder-brain-mpmm.md) can wreak ruin upon its rivals. |
| 3 | The decades-long machinations of an [ancient black dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md) and an evil [archmage](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) are nearing fruition. If their pact succeeds, they will unleash devastation on a continental scale. |
| 4 | An [ancient black dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-black-dragon.md) rules a vast, decadent city built on artificial islands within a polluted lake. The site is threatened with destruction by an enraged [archdruid](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/archdruid-mpmm.md)â€”but destroying the city means thousands of innocents will die. |
