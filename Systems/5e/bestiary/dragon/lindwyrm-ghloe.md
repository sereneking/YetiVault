# Lindwyrm

## Salvage

A dose of [lindwyrm venom](/Systems/5e/items/lindwyrm-venom-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) can be harvested by someone proficient with a poisoner's kit and succeeds on a DC 18 Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check, but this must be done within 1 hour of the lindwyrm's death. If the check fails by 5 or more, the harvester instead poisons themselves. This injury poison is worth 1,000 gp.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** Lindwyrms sleep for 100 years and when they waken are devastating to communities in its hunting area.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Lindwyrms have a poisonous bite and may swallow creatures they bite.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Nature](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Nature)).** Lindwyrms can sense vibrations in the ground from as far away as 120 ft.  

> [!note] GM Advice
> 
> One exciting adventure seed could find a powerful enemy of the adventurers looking to waken and control a lindwyrm. Whether that plot succeeds or not is up to you, but a three-way battle between involving a lindwyrm and other foes should be memorable as the action ebbs and flows.

## Traits

***Disease Immunity.*** The lindwyrm is immune to all nonmagical diseases.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the lindwyrm fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The lindwyrm makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws. The lindwyrm can substitute a swallow attack for one of its claw attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) piercing damage and the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, takingÂ 18 (`4d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a hit, the target is also [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the lindwyrm can't bite another target.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d8 + 6`) slashing damage.

***Swallow.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one Huge or smaller creature the lindwyrm is grappling. *Hit:* 22 (`3d10 + 6`) piercing damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lindwyrm, and it takes 27 (`6d8`) acid damage at the start of each of the lindwyrm's turns. The lindwyrm can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the lindwyrm takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the lindwyrm must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 10 feet of the lindwyrm. If the lindwyrm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Legendary Actions

***Claw Attack.*** The lindwyrm makes a claw attack.

***Burrowing Rush (Costs 2 Actions).*** The lindwyrm burrows its speed and comes up beneath a target touching the ground, making a bite attack. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
