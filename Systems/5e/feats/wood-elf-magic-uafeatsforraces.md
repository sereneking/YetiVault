# Wood Elf Magic
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: [Elf (Wood)](/Systems/5e/races/elf-wood.md)

You learn the magic of the primeval woods. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn [longstrider](/Systems/5e/spells/longstrider.md) and [pass without trace](/Systems/5e/spells/pass-without-trace.md), each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast the spell in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these spells.
