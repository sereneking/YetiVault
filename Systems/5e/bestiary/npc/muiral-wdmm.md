# Muiral
*Source: Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage p. 314*  

Muiral was an accomplished human warrior who long served as Halaster's bodyguard. His descent into madness began when he asked the Mad Mage to tutor him in the wizardly arts. Muiral learned enough magic to transform himself into a half-scorpion monstrosity, becoming known as Muiral the Misshapen. He then retired to the level of Undermountain that would later be called Muiral's Gauntlet, driving out and slaying its original drow denizens. Muiral now spends his days hunting adventurers and other interlopers for fun. Long years alone—and Halaster's influence—have rendered him utterly insane.
