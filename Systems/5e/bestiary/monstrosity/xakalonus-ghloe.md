# Xakalonus

## Salvage

A xakalonus brain is encased in a viscous jelly which can be turned into a substance called [arcane oil](/Systems/5e/items/arcane-oil-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis). This oil's creation requires a proficient alchemist to spend 8 hours and 200 gp of components. They must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check to create the substance.

## Lore

- **DC 15 Intelligence ([History](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#History)).** Xakalonus are created from wounds to the hraptnon. These creatures, though always originating in the Stillborn Forest, can be found anywhere in Etharis. They feed on the brains of creatures that use magic, then return to offer up the brain to the hraptnon.  
- **DC 20 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)).** If magic effects but does not harm a xakalonus, the magic might heal them or power their attacks instead.

## Traits

***Magic Absorption.*** If a xakalonus succeeds on a saving throw against a magical effect that would damage it, it takes no damage. Instead, the xakalonus regains 11 (`2d10`) hit points. Alternatively, if the xakalonus is at full hit points, the next successful melee attack by the xakalonus deals an additional 11 (`2d10`) force damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The xakalonus has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The xakalonus makes one bite and one claws attack.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (`2d8 + 4`) piercing damage.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (`2d10 + 4`) slashing damage.

***Sonic Bark (Recharge 5-6).*** All creatures within 30 ft. who can hear the xakalonus must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (`4d6`) thunder damage and be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of their next turn. Other xakalonus and the hraptnon are immune to this.
