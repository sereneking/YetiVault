This spell lets you convince a beast that you mean it no harm. Choose a beast that you can see within range. It must see and hear you. If the beast's Intelligence is 4 or higher, the spell fails. Otherwise, the beast must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you for the spell's duration. If you or one of your companions harms the target, the spell ends.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional beast for each slot level above 1st.

**Classes**: [Bard](/Systems/5e/classes/bard.md), [Cleric (Nature Domain)](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric-nature-domain.md), [Druid](/Systems/5e/classes/druid.md), [Ranger](/Systems/5e/classes/ranger.md)
