| 1 | I hate a certain mortal family and steal one of their children each generation for my own purposes. |
| 2 | I am involved in a centuries-long feud with a rival of similar power and status. |
| 3 | My house holds everything that I hold dear. I can't abide visitors who threaten my hearth and home. |
| 4 | I owe a great favor to a hag grandmother. |
| 5 | I traded away something before I realized it was priceless, and now I want it back. |
| 6 | My daughter was taken from me, and I want to find her and train her. |
