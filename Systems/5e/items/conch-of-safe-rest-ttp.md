# Conch of Safe Rest
*Other, unknown (magic)*  

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

You can use an action to blow this pearlescent conch like a [horn](/Systems/5e/items/horn.md), creating an effect identical with that of a [Leomund's tiny hut](/Systems/5e/spells/leomunds-tiny-hut.md) spell. The conch disappears once the spell takes effect. The effect ends if you leave the spell's area.
