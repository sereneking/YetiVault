# Aspirant of the Comet
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 91*  

Aspirants aren't yet initiated into the mysteries of the Heralds of the Comet, but they are firmly in the group's clutches, both socially and metaphysically. If an aspirant is killed, the hapless individual is drawn into the Void and devoured, body and soul.

## Traits

***Hunger of the Void.*** When the aspirant is reduced to 0 hit points, its body and everything it is wearing or carrying, except for magic items, are sucked into a void and destroyed. Creatures in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the aspirant must make a DC 11 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (`3d6`) necrotic damage and is pulled 10 feet straight toward the aspirant's space. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

***Sinister Devotion.*** The aspirant has advantage on saving throws against the [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) and [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) conditions.

## Actions

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) piercing damage, or 5 (`1d8 + 1`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.
