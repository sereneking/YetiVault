## Traits

***Dragon Fanatic.*** The dragonsoul has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened). While the dragonsoul can see a dragon or higher-ranking Cult of the Dragon cultist friendly to it, the dragonsoul ignores the effects of being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) or [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Fanatic Advantage.*** Once per turn, if the dragonsoul makes a weapon attack with advantage on the attack roll and hits, the target takes an extra 10 (`3d6`) damage.

***Limited Flight.*** The dragonsoul can use a bonus action to gain a flying speed of 30 feet until the end of its turn.

***Pack Tactics.*** The dragonsoul has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dragonsoul's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Dragonsoul attacks twice with its shortsword.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d6 + 3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`3d6`) damage of the type to which the dragonsoul has resistance.

***Orb of Dragon's Breath (3/Day).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (`6d8`) damage of the type to which the dragonsoul has damage resistance.
