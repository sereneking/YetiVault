# Invoke the Amaranthine
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Divination*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minute
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, a holy symbol of the Amaranthine
- **Duration:** 24 hour

You call upon the power of an Amaranthine to grant yourself insight into the Great Rhythm that moves all things. When you cast this spell, roll two `d20`s, and record what you rolled. For each die, choose either attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. You can choose each option multiple times. For the next 24 hours, you may substitute any roll of an ally or enemy you can see within 60 feet with one of the recorded numbers that matches the type of roll you wish to replace (attack roll, skill check, or saving throw). The target still adds any relevant modifiers to this number, but otherwise treat the substituted number as the number they rolled.

To do this, you must spend a reaction to present your holy symbol and invoke the name of the Amaranthine whose energies you called upon. You can do this anytime after the skill check, saving throw or attack has been rolled, but before the outcome of the event has been determined. The spell ends after 24 hours have passed, or when both dice have been expended.

**Classes**: [Cleric](/Systems/5e/classes/cleric.md), [Paladin](/Systems/5e/classes/paladin.md), [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/Systems/5e/classes/sorcerer-divine-soul-xge.md)
