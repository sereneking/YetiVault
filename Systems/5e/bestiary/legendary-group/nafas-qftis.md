# Nafas

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Nafas can take one of the following lair actions; he can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Downdraft.** Nafas targets one creature he can see within 120 feet of himself. A downward current of air surrounds the target, reducing its flying speed (if any) to 0 feet until the end of its next turn, and the target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or have the prone condition.  
- **Lightning Strike.** A bolt of lightning strikes a point Nafas can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`3d10`) lightning damage.  
- **Stardust.** Nafas creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of multiversal dust centered on a point anywhere in his lair. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The dust lasts until Nafas disperses it (no action required) or uses this lair action again, and it can't be dispersed by wind.  

## Regional effects


The region containing Nafas's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Mirages.** Sapient creatures within 3 miles of the lair frequently see illusions of their hearts' desires, be they fame, fortune, or long-departed comrades. These mirages don't hold up to physical inspection and vanish after a brief interaction.  
- **Safe Descents.** Within 3 miles of the lair, winds buoy creatures that fall, ushering them safely to the nearest staircase. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. Aberrations, Fiends, Undead, and creatures that fall due to Nafas's or his allies' actions don't gain this benefit, instead falling as normal.  
- **Wishful Winds.** The wishes of creatures across the multiverse, including those within the Infinite Staircase, can be heard within 3 miles of the lair as fleeting voices carried on gentle breezes.  

If Nafas is destroyed, all these effects end immediately, resuming when he either gains a new body or is replaced by the creature that slays him (see the Last Wish trait in Nafas's stat block).
