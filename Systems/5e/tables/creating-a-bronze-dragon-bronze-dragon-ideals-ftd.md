**Bronze Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-bronze-dragon-bronze-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^bronze-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Action. Passivity is shameful. We owe it to the world and ourselves to try to improve things, even if we can't guarantee success. (Any) |
| 2 | Analysis. When possible, dig into the root of a conflict before committing to end it, to ensure you aren't fighting for the wrong side. (Any) |
| 3 | Honor. I never lie outright, though I choose my words carefully. I will fight to the death rather than break my word or abandon a comrade. (Lawful) |
| 4 | Discipline. Disorganization breeds defeat. I demand self-control from both myself and those who fight beside me. (Lawful) |
| 5 | Guardianship. It's the duty of the strong to protect the weak. (Good) |
| 6 | Dominance. Anyone who opposes my will is either an underling to be punished or an enemy to be vanquished. (Evil) |
