| dice: d8 | Trait |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | People are so wonderfully varied, and I do so love experiencing life with them. |
| 2 | I'm an epicurean, and I live to eat all the delightful foods people concoct. |
| 3 | It's my duty as a member of an elder species to protect and guide other peoples. |
| 4 | I like coming up with new disguises to use among small folk. It makes me feel clever! |
| 5 | Violence is the provenance of uncouth beings, and I will do my best to avoid its use. |
| 6 | I don't understand why anyone would fight when they could talk instead and build on this ecosystem of wondrous cultures and fascinating traditions. |
| 7 | I owe the short-lived mortals I become friends with the responsibility of watching over their progeny. |
| 8 | People must earn my respectâ€”and they're failing badly. |
