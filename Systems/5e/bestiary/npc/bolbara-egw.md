## Traits

***Dark One's Blessing.*** When Bol'bara reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points, she gains 6 temporary hit points.

***Nimble Escape.*** Bol'bara can take the Disengage or Hide action as a bonus action on each of her turns.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Bol'bara's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12, `+4` to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**At will**: [eldritch blast](/Systems/5e/spells/eldritch-blast.md), [false life](/Systems/5e/spells/false-life.md), [mage armor](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-armor.md), [mage hand](/Systems/5e/spells/mage-hand.md)

**1/day each**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [hex](/Systems/5e/spells/hex.md), [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Bol'bara makes two melee attacks.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Eldritch Blast (Cantrip).*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 7 (`1d10 + 2`) force damage.

## Legendary Actions

***Incorporeal Dash.*** Bol'bara moves up to her speed. She can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

***Zone of Calamity (Costs 2 Actions).*** A 15-foot-radius sphere of magical confusion extends from a point Bol'bara can see within 60 feet of her and spreads around corners. Each creature that starts its turn in that area is treated as if targeted by the [confusion](/Systems/5e/spells/confusion.md) spell (save DC 12). The sphere lasts as long as Bol'bara maintains [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration), up to 1 minute (as if concentrating on a spell).
