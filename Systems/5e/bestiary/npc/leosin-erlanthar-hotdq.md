## Traits

***5etools Note.*** Leosin Erlanthar is presented in Hoard of the Dragon Queen as a half-elf monk. The [martial arts adept](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/martial-arts-adept-mpmm.md) stat block from "Volo's Guide to Monsters" has been provided here for ease of use.

***Unarmored Defense.*** While the adept is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The adept makes three unarmed strikes or three dart attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, the adept can choose one of the following additional effects:

- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (adept's choice).  
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).  
- The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of the adept's next turn.  

***Dart.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d4 + 3`) piercing damage.

## Reactions

***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `1d10 + 3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.
