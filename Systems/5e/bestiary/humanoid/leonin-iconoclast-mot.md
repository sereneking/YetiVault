# Leonin Iconoclast
*Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros p. 232*  

While leonin don't deny the existence of the gods, most denounce them, believing the deities are more likely to spread doom than peace and bounty. Some leonin, known as iconoclasts, devote themselves to thwarting the gods by hunting down their followers and all things born of Nyx that impede on Oreskos and the safety of the leonin prides.

Prides of leonin roam the plains of Oreskos, protecting the land and its creatures from interlopers, both mortal and immortal. As many leonin suffered at the hands of archon tyrants in ages past, today their prides largely avoid contact with other peoples and spurn the gods that ignored their plight. Since then, the leonin have flourished, finding strength in their bonds with one another and the land. Only in recent times have some leonin started guardedly looking beyond their homeland and wondering what role they might take in the wider world.

Most leonin hunters are tribal warriors, but those who hunt the servants of the gods rather than game are known as leonin iconoclasts.
