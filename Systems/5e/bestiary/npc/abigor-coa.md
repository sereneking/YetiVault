## Traits

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede Abigor's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** Abigor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Abigor makes four attacks using its Warhammer, Throwing Hammer, or a combination of the two.

***Warhammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`1d6`) thunder damage.

***Throwing Hammer.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+15` to hit, range 30/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`1d6`) thunder damage. Hammers thrown this way fall and stick into the ground after hitting their target and a new hammer appears in Abigor's hand.

***Thunderous Slam (Recharge 5-6).*** Abigor causes all its hammers left on the battlefield to bristle with thunderous energy, exploding outwards with a roar. All creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on each hammer must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. Targets take 26 (`4d12`) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature is within multiple spheres, it must make the save multiple times, taking damage from each source.

## Legendary Actions

***Throw Hammer.*** Abigor makes a Throwing Hammer attack.

***Call Thunder (Costs 2 Actions).*** Abigor targets a hammer that it can see within 60 feet to let out a thunderous roar. Creatures within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the hammer must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 26 (`4d12`) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
