# Baernaloth

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a baernaloth can take one of the following lair actions; the baernaloth can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Consume Suffering..** Until initiative count 20 on the next round, when a creature in the baernaloth's lair other than the baernaloth takes necrotic or psychic damage or drops to 0 hit points, the baernaloth regains 10 (`3d6`) hit points.  
- **Discover Secrets..** The baernaloth uses Spellcasting to cast detect thoughts. A creature targeted by the spell cast in this way takes 13 (`3d8`) psychic damage.  
- **Recurring Wound..** A creature that doesn't have all its hit points and that the baernaloth can see in its lair must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (`4d10`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

## Regional effects


A region containing a baernaloth's lair becomes warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Persistent Anguish..** Within 10 miles of a baernaloth's lair, when a creature casts a spell that either restores hit points or removes the charmed or frightened condition, the spell fails and is wasted unless the caster succeeds on a DC 19 saving throw using its spellcasting ability. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is immune to this regional effect for 24 hours.  
- **Slow Healing..** Within 10 miles of a baernaloth's lair, a creature other than the baernaloth regains only hit points equal to half its hit point maximum when it finishes a long rest, and it regains only half the usual number of hit points when it spends Hit Dice during a short rest.  

If the baernaloth dies, these effects end immediately.
