## Actions

***Shocking Grasp (Cantrip).*** *Melee Spell Attack:* `+8` to hit (with advantage if the target is wearing armor made of metal), reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (`3d8`) lightning damage, and the target can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

***Fireball (3rd-Level Spell; 3/Day).*** The sage creates a fiery explosion centered on a point it can see within 150 feet of it. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (`8d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners and ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

## Reactions

***Shield (1st-Level Spell; 3/Day).*** When the sage is hit by an attack or targeted by a [magic missile](/Systems/5e/spells/magic-missile.md) spell, it calls forth an [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) barrier of magical force that protects it. Until the start of its next turn, the sage has a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and it takes no damage from magic missile.
