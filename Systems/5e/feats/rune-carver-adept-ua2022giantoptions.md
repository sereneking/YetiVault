# Rune Carver Adept
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th-level

Your skill with the art of runecraft has increased.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can now mark a number of objects equal to your proficiency bonus with a rune from the Rune Carver Apprentice feat. An object can have only one rune at a time, and you must inscribe a different rune on each object.
