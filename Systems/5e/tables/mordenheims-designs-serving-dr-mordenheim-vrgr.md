| dice: d4 | Mission |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | The doctor desires a cutting-edge discovery from a factory in Neufurchtenburg. To acquire it, she has kidnapped the factory owner's family and put the characters' consciousnesses into their bodies. Until the characters deliver the discovery, she holds their bodies and the family's brains in cold storage. |
| 2 | Wishing to spy on Ludendorf University, Mordenheim mounts the characters' heads onto suits of [animated armor](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/animated-armor.md). The characters will get their bodies back when they return with the information the doctor desires. |
| 3 | Agents of Baron von Aubrecker attack Schloss Mordenheim and wreak considerable damage. Dr. Mordenheim places the characters' brains into [flesh golems](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md) and sets them loose to punish the baron. |
| 4 | Dr. Mordenheim wants [Elise](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/elise-vrgr.md) found and returned. Using various monster parts, she creates unique hunter bodies with the statistics of [flesh golems](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md) or   other monsters. She places the characters' minds into these bodies, promising to restore them when they bring her [Elise](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/elise-vrgr.md). |
