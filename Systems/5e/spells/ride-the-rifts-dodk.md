# Ride the Rifts
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-feet line)
- **Components:** V, S, a delerium fragment worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

When you cast this spell, you gain one level of contamination. A stroke of eldritch lightning forming a line 60 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `10d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within the line's area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `2d6` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/Systems/5e/classes/fighter-eldritch-knight.md), [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/Systems/5e/classes/rogue-arcane-trickster.md)
