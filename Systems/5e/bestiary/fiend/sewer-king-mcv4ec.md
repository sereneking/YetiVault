# Sewer King
*Source: Monstrous Compendium Volume 3: 4: Eldraine Creatures*  

Sewer kings are hulking, monstrous rats empowered by fiendish blood. This unholy influence gives sewer kings their enormous size, supernatural strength, wicked cunning, and ability to speak.

Deep in the bowels of towns and cities, sewer kings reign over underground vermin, dreaming of the day when rats will overthrow surface dwellers. Rancid saliva drips from a sewer king's maw, and swarms of vermin skitter at the monstrous rat's beck and call.

> 
> Lord Skitter is a sewer king who lives deep in the ancient dwarven ruins beneath the town of Edgewall, situated in the lands between the realm and the wilds of Eldraine. Deep within these ruins, a human minstrel named Totentanz encountered Lord Skitter and struck a vile bargain. Lord Skitter promised the piper wicked and wondrous powers in exchange for Totentanz luring the townsfolk of Edgewall into the sewer king's subterranean domain to become food for his rat minions.
