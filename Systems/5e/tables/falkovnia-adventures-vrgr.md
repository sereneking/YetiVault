**Falkovnia Adventures**

`dice: [](falkovnia-adventures-vrgr.md#^falkovnia-adventures)`

| dice: d10 | Adventure |
|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | The party discovers a town where [zombies](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) have begun acting strangely: plowing fields, tarrying in shops, and congregating in the crumbling temple. What's causing this odd behavior? |
| 2 | In Morfenzi, Vjorn Horstman envisions an army of bestial super soldiers. He works to perfect what he calls his "primal serum," an elixir that inflicts those injected with a random form of lycanthropy. He seeks to use the characters as test subjects. |
| 3 | A plague strikes the slums of Lekar. Those killed by the disease rise as [zombie plague spreaders](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/zombie-plague-spreader-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5"). |
| 4 | A pack of zombie animals—predominantly wolves, ravens, and cattle—attacks work bands from Lekar and survivors upon the roads. The characters are enlisted to serve as guards. |
| 5 | The characters are sent to investigate a fallen star that crashed near the village of Delmunster. The village proves remarkably peaceful and free of zombies, in large part because it's populated by the [podlings](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/podling-vrgr.md) of a [bodytaker plant](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/bodytaker-plant-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5"). |
| 6 | A character learns that an influential Talon plans to overthrow General Drakov during the next zombie assault on Lekar by sabotaging the city's defenses and admitting the zombies to the Bastion Ward. |
| 7 | The Jimsonweeds, a band of survivors in Silbervas, vanish after attempting to pillage Dekovan Palace. Soon after, the palace's strange lights appear among buildings formerly claimed by the lost survivors. |
| 8 | A knight named Gondegal attacks Talon patrols and claims she can lead common folk to a safe holdfast. None who go with her are seen again. The Talons hire the party to hunt down the knight. |
| 9 | The characters learn of downtrodden citizens in Lekar plotting to escape into the Mists following the next zombie siege. Are the citizens desperate noncombatants, or are they Talon agents seeking to draw out "traitors"? |
| 10 | On the night of the new moon, no zombie horde appears at Lekar's walls. Instead, a undead messenger arrives with a missive for General Drakov. |
