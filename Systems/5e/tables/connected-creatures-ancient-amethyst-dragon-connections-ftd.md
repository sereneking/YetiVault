|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A yuan-ti cult known as the Serpents of the Dreaming City draws power from an [ancient amethyst dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-amethyst-dragon-ftd.md), which the cultists keep in eternal slumber with braziers of enchanted smoke. |
| 2 | A rogue [purple worm](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/purple-worm.md) swallowed a large portion of an amethyst dragon's hoard before burrowing back into the deep Underdark. The dragon has a magic crystal that can trace the worm's movement. |
| 3 | An [ancient amethyst dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-amethyst-dragon-ftd.md) is able to awaken psionic potential in others, and many of the greatest psi warriors in history were the dragon's students. |
| 4 | After centuries guarding the world against incursions from the Far Realm, an [ancient amethyst dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-amethyst-dragon-ftd.md) has been corrupted by aberrant influences and now leads a cult the dragon once opposed. |
