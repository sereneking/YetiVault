`dice: [](creating-a-topaz-dragon-topaz-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^topaz-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Solitude. My own company obviates the need for others in my life, whether they are dragons or lesser creatures. (Any) |
| 2 | Change. Consistency is stagnation. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Mental Superiority. I hone my mental powers so I can confuse, control, or kill any who annoy me. (Evil) |
| 4 | Territoriality. Any creature that comes into my territory has forfeited its right to be upset by anything I do to it. (Evil) |
| 5 | Wonder. Though I don't wish to spend time in it, my soul sings at the sight of the vast beauty of the ocean. (Good) |
| 6 | Code of Combat. I despise most other dragons, but I meet them face to face without resorting to the base trickery I use on lesser creatures. (Lawful) |
