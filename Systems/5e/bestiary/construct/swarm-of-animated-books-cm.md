## Traits

***False Objects.*** If the swarm is motionless at the start of combat, it has advantage on its initiative roll. Moreover, if a creature hasn't observed the swarm move or act, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check to discern that the swarm is animate.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a 1-foot-tall, 8-inch-wide, 2-inch-thick object. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions

***Book Club.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 6 (`2d4 + 1`) bludgeoning damage, or 3 (`1d4 + 1`) bludgeoning damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer.
