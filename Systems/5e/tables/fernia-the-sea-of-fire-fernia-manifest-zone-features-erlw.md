**Fernia Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](fernia-the-sea-of-fire-fernia-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^fernia-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Spells that deal fire damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 2 | Weapons and armor with unusual abilities can be forged here, though their enchantments are not always stable. |
| 3 | The area is dotted with pools of molten earth and fissures of scalding water, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity. |
| 4 | Motes of [continual flame](/Systems/5e/spells/continual-flame.md) are spontaneously generated in this region, typically attached to some vegetation or minerals from the area. These flames persist even if they are removed from the region. |
