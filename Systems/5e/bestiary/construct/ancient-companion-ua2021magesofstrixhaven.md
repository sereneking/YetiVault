## Traits

***Ancient Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the companion to 0 hit points, it can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, the companion drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Sage's Counsel (Sage Only).*** While within 15 feet of the companion, you and your allies gain a +2 bonus to Intelligence and Wisdom checks.

## Actions

***Spirit Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target you can see. *Hit:* `1d8 + 2 + PB` force damage.

***Healer's Light (Healer Only).*** The companion chooses a creature it can see within 15 feet of itself and flares with invigorating light. The creature gains `1d8 + PB` temporary hit points.

## Reactions

***Warrior's Protection (Warrior Only).*** When a creature within 5 feet of the companion makes a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, the companion imposes itself between the creature and the danger. The creature can roll a `d4` and add the number rolled to the saving throw.
