| dice: d6 | Flaw |
|----------|------|
| 1 | The ordning is too restrictive for the likes of me. |
| 2 | The lesser creatures of the world have no souls |
| 3 | Unity among giants is a myth, anyone not of my clan is a fair target for my weapons. |
| 4 | I care nothing for what others expect, to the point where I cannot help but contradict what others ask of me. |
| 5 | I am terrified of arcane magic and can be cowed by overt displays of it. |
| 6 | Ancient dragons fill me with dread. My knees grow weak in their presence. |
