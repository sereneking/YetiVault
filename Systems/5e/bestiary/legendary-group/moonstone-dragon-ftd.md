# Moonstone Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon can take one of the following lair actions; the dragon can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Banish into Dream.** The dragon targets a creature it can see within 120 feet of it and attempts to send that creature to a dream plane. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a harmless demiplane until initiative count 20 on the next round. While there, the target is [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned). When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space.  
- **Compulsive Dance.** The dragon targets a creature it can see in its lair, and a merry waltz begins to play that only the target can hear. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or dance until initiative count 20 on the following round. The dancing creature is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) and must use all its movement to dance.  
- **Disorienting Visions.** Disorienting illusory images flit through the dragon's lair. Each creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on ability checks until initiative count 20 on the following round.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Fizban's Treasury of Dragons_

The region surrounding a legendary moonstone dragon's lair is altered by the dragon's magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Dream Communication.** Whenever a creature that can understand a language sleeps or enters a state of trance or reverie within 6 miles of the dragon's lair, the dragon can establish telepathic contact with that creature and converse with it in its dreams. The creature remembers its conversation with the dragon upon waking.  
- **Planar Transition.** The veil between planes is thinned near a moonstone dragon's lair. Various portals link the Material Plane, the Feywild, and the Border Ethereal within 6 miles of the lair. Creatures can pass through a portal in either direction by spending 5 feet of movement.  

If the dragon dies, any portals near the lair close immediately.
