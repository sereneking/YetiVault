# Ruidium Elephant
*Source: Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep p. 95*  

Unknown to anyone who has come into contact with it, the elephant figurine was infected with ruidium during its time in Cael Morrow, and that substance has warped its magical properties.

When a character tries to retrieve the figurine, it reacts as if it had been activated, transforming into a crystalline version of the creature it was meant to become. This creature can't be controlled.
