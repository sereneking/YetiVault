**Xoriat Manifest Zone Features**

`dice: [](xoriat-the-realm-of-madness-xoriat-manifest-zone-features-erlw.md#^xoriat-manifest-zone-features)`

| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Reality is frayed here. Casting any spell of 1st level or higher triggers a roll on the [Wild Magic Surge](/Systems/5e/tables/wild-magic-surge.md) table in chapter 3 of the "Player's Handbook". |
| 2 | A character must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw at the end of each hour spent in this place. On a failed save, the character is afflicted with a random form of short-term madness (see "chapter 8" of the "Dungeon Master's Guide"). |
| 3 | Residents of a settlement here display bizarre mutations and unsettling behavior. Visitors who stay too long develop odd characteristics as well. |
| 4 | A cavern here is a cancerous tumor that issues forth aberrations to prey upon the world, and it is growing. |
