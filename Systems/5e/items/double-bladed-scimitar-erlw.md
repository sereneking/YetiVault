# Double-Bladed Scimitar
*Melee Weapon*  

- **Damage**: 2d4 S
- **Properties**: Martial, [Special](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Special), [Two-handed](/Systems/5e/rules/item-properties.md#Two-handed)
- **Cost**: 100 gp
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

The double-bladed scimitar is the signature weapon of Valenar elves. A haft of fine wood supports a long, curving blade on either end. Forged with techniques honed over centuries, these blades are strong, sharp, and remarkably light. Each scimitar is a masterpiece, and as a result the double-bladed scimitar is an expensive weapon (100 gp)â€”few though ever have the opportunity to purchase one. A Valenar blade in the hands of a non-elf is generally assumed to have been stolen or looted from a fallen foe, and a Valenar elf might feel entitled to demand its return or challenge the bearer to prove they're worthy to wield it.

## Special

If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals `1d4` slashing damage on a hit, instead of `2d4`.
