| dice: d4 | Feature |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | Bodies buried here reanimate in `1d4` days, possessed by restless spirits. These spirits might be malevolent or benign. |
| 2 | Any necromancy spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended. |
| 3 | Spells and abilities that raise the dead have a 50% chance chance to bring back `1d4` angry spirits as well. These might be banshees, ghosts, shadows, specters, wraiths, or other incorporeal undead. |
| 4 | In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in the zone, the caster must succeed on a Constitution check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost. |
