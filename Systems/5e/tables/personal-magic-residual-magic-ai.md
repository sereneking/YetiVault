`dice: [](personal-magic-residual-magic-ai.md#^residual-magic)`

| dice: d10 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | A smell just slightly less noxious than troglodyte musk wafts off you from time to time. |
| 2 | At random, your voice shifts three octaves higher or lower than normal. |
| 3 | Your hair changes color for 1 hour. If you don't have hair, you grow silver hair that lasts for 1 hour, then falls out. |
| 4 | At random, your speech and movement suggest that you are blind drunk. |
| 5 | Your eyes glow for 1 minute, cycling intermittently through red, blue, and green. |
| 6 | Sometimes when you deal damage to a creature, a disembodied voice near you shouts out, "Boo yah!" |
| 7 | Blood momentarily drips from your ears and eyes. |
| 8 | Your fingernails grow out to gnarled talons. This new growth falls off after 10 minutes or if you touch something. |
| 9 | Intermittently, any somatic components for spells you cast take the form of violent coughing. |
| 10 | For 1 minute, you are 6 inches shorter or taller than normal. |
