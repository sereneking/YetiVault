# Servo Crafting
*Source: Plane Shift: Kaladesh p. 13*  

**Prerequisite**: Intelligence 13 or higher

You are skilled in the creation of [servos](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/servo-psk.md)â€”tiny constructs that function as personal assistants. You can cast the [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md) spell as a ritual, creating a [servo](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/servo-psk.md) to serve as your familiar instead of an animal. A [servo](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/servo-psk.md)'s statistics appear in the "Artifact Creatures" section of this document. In every other way, a servo familiar functions as described in the [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md) spell.

You can communicate telepathically with your servo familiar and perceive through its senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence. You can speak through your servo in your own voice.

Additionally, when you take the [Attack](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Attack) action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your servo familiar to make one attack of its own.
