**Headquarters Locations**

| dice: d10 | Headquarters |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | A tavern once owned by smugglers. Tunnel entrances have clearly been bricked over, and no one's quite sure where they all lead. |
| 2 | A simple chapel to a long-forgotten god. The pews are awfully uncomfortable, but fragrant incense burns without ceasing. |
| 3 | A battle-worn castle. A real fixer-upper, it's seen better days. Better years. Maybe even better centuries. |
| 4 | A top-of-the-line naval vessel that has somehow been stranded miles inland. |
| 5 | A private library. The franchise is free to use the space as long as no harm comes to the books. |
| 6 | A hollowed-out statue of an ancient king. |
| 7 | An early model airship. Very early. The balloon is mostly patches at this pointâ€”a motley assortment of ship sails, cloaks, and animal skins. |
| 8 | A former blacksmith's shop, which was a former exercise studio, and a former cafe before that. |
| 9 | A multicolor waterproof canvas stretched over a succession of jutting stone columns. Within, it always appears to be late spring. |
| 10 | A creaking wagon that smells of turnips, and which is bigger inside than out. |
