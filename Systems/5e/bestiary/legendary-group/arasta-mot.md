# Arasta

## Lair actions
_Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Arasta can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects. She can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Arasta learns about any creature touching her webs. Each creature [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by a web or Arasta's Web of Hair must make a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, Arasta gains knowledge of a creature's name, race, where they consider home, and what brought them to her web.  
- Arasta casts the [giant insect](/Systems/5e/spells/giant-insect.md) spell (spiders only). It lasts until she uses this lair action again or until she dies.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Arasta's lair is warped by her presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Spiders and insects within 1 mile of Arasta's lair serve as her eyes and ears. Birds and other flying creatures are absent from the skies and occasionally found trapped in webs.  
- Within 1 mile of Arasta's lair, webs fill all 10-foot cubes of open space, so long as the webs can be anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees). The webs are flammable. Any webs exposed to fire burn away in 1 round. Any destroyed webs are magically repaired at the next dawn.  

If Arasta dies, the spiders and insects lose their supernatural link to her. The webs remain, but they dissolve within `1d10` days.

## Mythic encounter
_Source: Mythic Odysseys of Theros_

Arasta is a formidable enemy under normal circumstances, but to give characters a truly mythic challenge, you can have her call on her Armor of Spiders. Her use of this trait signals a drastic turn in the encounter, as Arasta summons her arachnid children to protect her. While she has temporary hit points from this trait, she can choose one of her mythic actions when she uses a legendary action.

Read or paraphrase the following text when Arasta uses her Armor of Spiders trait:

> The nightmarish arachnid unleashes a shriek that sounds like a thousand spider carapaces scarring slate. In response, the ground ripples and bursts over the monster, revealing itself as a [wave](/Systems/5e/items/wave.md) of countless spiders. The tiny arachnids swarm the larger horror, girding it in skittering bodies.

Fighting Arasta as a mythic encounter is equivalent to taking on two challenge rating 21 creatures in one encounter. Award a party 66,000 XP for defeating Arasta after she uses Armor of Spiders.
