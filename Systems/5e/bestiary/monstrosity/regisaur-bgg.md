# Regisaur
*Source: Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants p. 130*  

Aptly called "the ruler of dinosaurs," a regisaur is an enormous predator large enough to swallow a giant whole. Fiery veins of elemental energy course through its skin and glow in its eyes and nostrils.

## Dinosaurs

When Annam's children first began to populate the worlds of the Material Plane, the All-Father created behemoth dinosaurs to live alongside them as companions. The primeval magic used to create the dinosaurs still thrums through their being and manifests in colorful, scar-like lines on their towering bodies. Some of these ancient dinosaurs persist in timeless jungles, hidden enclaves, and other lands untouched by the rest of the world.

## Traits

***Magic Resistance.*** The regisaur has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The regisaur makes one Bite attack and one Tail attack. The regisaur can't target the same creature with both attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 47 (`6d12 + 8`) piercing damage, and the target has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition, and the regisaur can't Bite another target.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (`4d8 + 8`) bludgeoning damage.

## Bonus Actions

***Swallow.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 5 ft., one Huge or smaller creature [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) by the regisaur. *Hit:* The regisaur swallows the target, and the grapple ends. A swallowed creature has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) conditions, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the regisaur, and it takes 7 (`2d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns. The regisaur can have up to two creatures swallowed at a time.

If the regisaur takes 25 damage or more on a single turn from a swallowed creature, the regisaur must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls in a space within 5 feet of the regisaur and has the [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition; the creature no longer has the [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) conditions.
