# Zephyr Armor
*Generic Variant, rare (requires attunement)*  


This fine set of white-and-silver armor bears the wind rune upon its chest.

While wearing this armor, you have advantage on Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) checks and Dexterity saving throws as your movements are bolstered by gentle currents of wind.

## Invoking the Rune

As an action, you can invoke the armor's rune to cast the [wind wall](/Systems/5e/spells/wind-wall.md) spell (save DC 15) with it. Once the rune has been invoked, it can't be invoked again until the next dawn.
