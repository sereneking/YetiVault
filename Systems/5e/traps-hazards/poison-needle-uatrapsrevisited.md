# Poison Needle
*Generic Hazard*  

A tiny, [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) needle hidden in a lock is the perfect way to discourage thieves from plundering a hoard. Such a trap is usually put in a chest or in the door to a treasure chamber. Trigger. Anyone attempting to pick or open the lock triggers the trap.
