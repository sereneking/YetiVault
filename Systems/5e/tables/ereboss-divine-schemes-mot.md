| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Erebos has captured Phenax's eidolon, the identity severed from Phenax's body when he became the first Returned, and uses it to force Phenax to serve his whims. |
| 2 | Erebos unleashes a deadly plague. The cure grows only in the peaceful Underworld realm of Ilysia. Mortal champions flock to Ilysia, threatening to breach the ward's sanctity and allow Erebos's influence to creep in. |
| 3 | Servants of Heliod find a stone that can raise the dead in both body and soul. Enraged, Erebos sends his followers to claim the stone, which Heliod's worshipers have claimed as a holy relic. |
| 4 | With the aid of Pharika, Erebos creates a poison capable of killing a god. Learning of this, the other gods try to force Erebos to relinquish the poison, but the god of the dead has already deployed it in the form of a sapient being. Now, champions of the gods scour the world, searching for the living weapon. |
