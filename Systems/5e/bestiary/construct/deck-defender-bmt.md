## Traits

***Allied Knight.*** Some of the deck defender's statistics are based on the character who drew the Knight card. Where the deck defender stat block refers to "you," it refers to that character.

***Folded Versatility.*** After finishing a long rest, you can refold the deck defender's shape, changing it to acrobat form, berserker form, or guardian form.

***Fragile.*** If the deck defender is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a haphazard pile of nonmagical playing cards and can't be resurrected or reconstructed.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The deck defender makes a number of attacks equal to half its proficiency bonus (rounded down).

***Paper Cut.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* PB + `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`1d8 + 3`) slashing damage.

***Reckless Strike (Berserker Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* PB + `+3` to hit (with advantage), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`2d6 + 3`) slashing damage, and attacks made against the deck defender until the start of its next turn have advantage.

## Bonus Actions

***Swift Step (Acrobat Form Only).*** The deck defender takes the Dash or Disengage action.

## Reactions

***Protection (Guardian Form Only).*** When a creature the deck defender can see attacks a target other than the deck defender and is within 5 feet of the deck defender, the deck defender imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.
