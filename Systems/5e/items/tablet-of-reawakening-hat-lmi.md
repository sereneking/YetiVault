# Tablet of Reawakening
*Wondrous Item, legendary*  


Witches of Rashemen created this Tiny stone tablet to counter the necromancy of the Red Wizards. As an action, you can cast [true resurrection](/Systems/5e/spells/true-resurrection.md) from the tablet. Once used in this way, the tablet turns to dust and is destroyed.
