**Outlands Constructs**

`dice: [](outlands-constructs-mpp.md#^outlands-constructs)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | A tyrannical [homunculus](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/homunculus.md) rules over the small domain of its long-lost archmage master. |
| 2 | A beautiful but vain [flesh golem](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/flesh-golem.md) influenced by "Arborea" insists on following a character until the character sketches, sculpts, or otherwise artistically renders it. |
| 3 | A gang of inquisitive [monodrones](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/monodrone.md) and its [duodrone](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/duodrone.md) leader insist on following a character, saying they expect that individual's doom to be "statistically noteworthy." |
| 4 | A [clay golem](/Systems/5e/bestiary/construct/clay-golem.md) influenced by "the Beastlands" has been transformed into the walking hive that's home to numerous [swarms of insects (wasps)](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/swarm-of-wasps.md). |
