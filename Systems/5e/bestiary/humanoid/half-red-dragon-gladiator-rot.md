## Traits

***Brave.*** The half-dragon has advantage on saving throws against being [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened).

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the half-dragon hits with it (included in the attack).

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The half-dragon makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) piercing damage, or 13 (`2d8 + 4`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (`2d4 + 4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The half-dragon exhales fire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 24 (`7d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Reactions

***Parry.*** The half-dragon adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the half-dragon must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
