When demonic influence corrupts the leadership of a people or an organization, the leaders might embrace abyssal magic to make tanarukks, using these ferocious warriors to bolster their followers' strength.

The demon lord [Baphomet](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/baphomet-mpmm.md) gladly shares the secret of creating tanarukks with those who entreat him for power; the cult of Gruumsh has also mastered a ritual for this purpose, and bestows it on those deemed worthy. Whatever process is used corrupts the subject, transforming them into a vicious Fiend.

Although tanarukks are valued as fearsome fighters, they are a threat to their allies off the battlefield. When not in combat, a tanarukk is destructive and volatile and is usually kept imprisoned by its allies. If unrestrained, a free tanarukk embarks on a rampage, attempting to take over by force. Most such coups fail but are costly nonetheless. If a tanarukk does seize the leadership of a group, reckless raiding or even war is the course they inevitably choose.
