|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | A giant who worships Vaprak leads ogres and ettins in a rebellion against their steading. The leaders ask adventurers for help. |
| 2 | Adventurers traveling underground become lost in a labyrinthine network of passages and are hunted by stone giant cultists of Baphomet. |
| 3 | A storm giant devotee of Demogorgon begins summoning the Prince of Demons in a sea cave, but before the ritual is complete, hordes of aquatic monsters swarm the area. Local fishers seek protection. |
| 4 | After being cast out from a steading, a frost giant devotee of Kostchtchie attacks caravans. The drivers hire adventurers as guards. |
| 5 | The characters discover a large horde of gnolls attacking a hill giant steading, but the more gnolls the hill giants kill (and eat), the more the giants seem to change into demonic forms. |
| 6 | The characters experience a series of small earthquakes while visiting a mountain town. Their investigation suggests Evil Earth cultists might be active nearby, practicing for a larger catastrophe. A stone giant leads the cult. |
| 7 | Adventurers encounter a longboat crewed by frost giant cultists of Evil Water, which is plundering a busy trade route. |
| 8 | Forest gnomes seek protection from Evil Fire cultists who are burning the forest, having grown impatient waiting for Surtur to cleanse the world in flames. |
