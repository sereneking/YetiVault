# Monstrous Peryton

## Traits

***Flyby.*** The peryton doesn't provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy's reach.

***Keen Sight and Smell.*** The peryton has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight or smell.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the peryton fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The peryton makes two attacks: one with its gore and one with its talons.

***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) piercing damage.

***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (`2d10 + 5`) slashing damage.

***Warp Shadow.*** The peryton chooses up to three creatures within 60 feet of it that it can see. Each creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become cursed. While cursed, whenever the creature makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, it must roll a `d4` and subtract that number from the roll. A cursed creature can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to this peryton's Warp Shadow for 24 hours.

## Legendary Actions

***Detect.*** The peryton makes a Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) check.

***Talons Attack.*** The peryton makes one attack with its talons.

***Dive Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The peryton moves up to its speed toward one target of its choosing. It then makes a gore attack that deals an extra 9 (`2d8`) piercing damage on a hit.
