| dice: d4 | Development |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Ankhtepot is now mortal, but retains all his supernatural abilities. Newly invigorated, the tyrant takes a more active role in Har'Akir's rulership, indulging in decadences and forcing the people to raise vast monuments to his newfound glory. |
| 2 | Ankhtepot is only briefly mortal. His body rapidly wastes away, returning him to his Undead state. Furious, he unleashes his deathless hordes, intent on transforming Har'Akir into an afterlife of his own making. |
| 3 | Ankhtepot is reborn and soon after dies for good. The remaining Children of Ankhtepot turn against one another, each declaring themself Pharaoh Ankhtepot II. |
| 4 | Ankhtepot is reborn, dies, is cursed by the gods anew, and is locked within a hidden tomb. Har'Akir falls to chaos as the land is scoured by squabbling mummies, a fruitless revolution, and harsh storms. Only by returning Ankhtepot to power can the land be saved. |
