# Rune Carver Apprentice
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: 2022 Giant Options p. 5*  

You've begun studying the art of runecraft, which allows you to temporarily mark your items and imbue them with magic.

Whenever you finish a long rest, you can mark one nonmagical weapon, armor, piece of clothing, or other object you can touch with a rune of your choice. You temporarily learn one 1st-level spell based on the rune you choose, as specified in the Rune Spells table, and you know the spell until you finish a long rest, when the rune fades.
