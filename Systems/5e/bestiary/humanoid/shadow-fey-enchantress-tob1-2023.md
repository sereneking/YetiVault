# Shadow Fey Enchantress
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 160*  

*This ravishing shadow fey woman moves with alluring grace. Her voice rings like a bell, and in her hearing, worldly cares and sorrows melt away.*

Beyond even great physical beauty, the sheer presence of a shadow fey enchantress can lay the most stalwart foes low. Almost universally female, Enchantresses are beautiful beyond compare.

## Enchanting Shadows

Enchantresses are also powerful spellcasters who infuse their words and manner with the beguiling power of shadow to turn enemies against one another with a few words and a deadly smile. They augment the force of their minds with fey-wrought blades, infusing their weapons with power that shreds their victims' psyche as well as their flesh.

## Traits

***Fey Ancestry.*** The enchantress has advantage on saving throws against being [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed), and magic can't put her to sleep.

***Phrenic Weapons.*** The enchantress's weapon attacks are magical. When she hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `4d6` psychic damage (included in the attack).

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the shadow fey has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

***Spellcasting.*** The enchantress casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 15):

**At will**: [command](/Systems/5e/spells/command.md), [message](/Systems/5e/spells/message.md)

**1/day**: [confusion](/Systems/5e/spells/confusion.md), [dominate person](/Systems/5e/spells/dominate-person.md), [greater invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-invisibility.md), [hold monster](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-monster.md), [phantasmal killer](/Systems/5e/spells/phantasmal-killer.md)

**3/day**: [charm person](/Systems/5e/spells/charm-person.md), [enthrall](/Systems/5e/spells/enthrall.md), [fear](/Systems/5e/spells/fear.md), [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md), [hypnotic pattern](/Systems/5e/spells/hypnotic-pattern.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The shadow fey enchantress makes two Rapier attacks. She can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting.

***Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d8 + 2`) piercing damage plus 14 (`4d6`) psychic damage.

***Shadow Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+7` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`2d6 + 4`) cold damage plus 9 (`2d8`) necrotic damage.

***Beguiling Whispers (Recharge 5-6).*** The enchantress speaks sweet words to a creature she can see within 60 feet of her and that can hear her. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) for 1 minute. While [charmed](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#charmed) in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma saving throws against spells cast by the enchantress.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the enchantress can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that she can see within 30 feet of her makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `d4` to its roll, provided it can hear and understand the enchantress. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the enchantress is [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).

## Bonus Actions

***Shadow Traveler (3/Day).*** While in shadows, dim light, or darkness, the shadow fey disappears into the darkness and reappears in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. A tendril of inky smoke appears at the origin and destination when it uses this bonus action.
