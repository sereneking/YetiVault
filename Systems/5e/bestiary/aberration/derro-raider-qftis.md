# Derro Raider
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 196*  

Hostility and greed are guiding values for some derro. These derro indiscriminately raid settlements and rob travelers regardless of the apparent value of any goods they steal. These derro believe such acts are sanctioned by their despicable god, Diirinka, who delights in cruelty and destruction.

## Derro

Derro are Underdark dwellers of dubious origin. According to the histories of some duergar, derro are descended from a community of dwarves that was left behind when the others escaped the rule of mind flayers. The mind flayers' psionic power eventually transformed these forsaken dwarves into Aberrations.

You can learn more about derro in*Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse*.
