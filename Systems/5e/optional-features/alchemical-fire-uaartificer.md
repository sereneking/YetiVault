# Alchemical Fire
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 5*  

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel, pull out a vial of volatile liquid, and hurl the vial at a creature, object, or surface within 30 feet of you (the vial and its contents disappear if you don't hurl the vial by the end of the current turn). On impact, the vial detonates in a 5-foot radius. Any creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `1d6` fire damage. This formula's damage increases by `1d6` when you reach certain levels in this class: 4th level (`2d6`), 7th level (`3d6`), 10th level (`4d6`), 13th level (`5d6`), 16th level (`6d6`), and 19th level (`7d6`).
