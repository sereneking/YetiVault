# Scorchbringer Guard
*Source: Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica p. 243*  

While chemisters focus on inventing new tools, weapons, and other devices for the guild to use, the role of a blastseeker is to put those devices to work. Despite the name, not all such devices produce explosions, but all the most interesting ones (from the Izzet perspective) do.

## Traits

***Explosive Tank.*** When the guard dies, or if it rolls a 1 when checking whether its Scorchbringer action recharges, the tank on its back explodes in a 10-foot radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (`2d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the scorchbringer.

## Actions

***Light Hammer.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d4 + 2`) bludgeoning damage.

***Scorchbringer (Recharge 4-6).*** The guard's scorchbringer spouts a stream of flame in a line that is 30 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (`2d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
