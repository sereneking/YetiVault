# Haze Husk
*Source: Dungeons of Drakkenheim p. 197*  

Those who die in the ruins find no respite. The Haze reanimates their remains to wander the streets as shells forever stuck in the terror of their final moments. Billowing eldritch energies emanate from their eyes, mouth, and wounds and delerium fragments are fused into their flesh.

## Traits

***Death Burst.*** If damage reduces the haze husk to 0 hit points, the delerium fragments in its body explode in a burst of contaminated energy, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. Each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) necrotic damage. Creatures who fail this saving throw by 5 or more gain one level of contamination.

## Actions

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (`1d6 + 1`) bludgeoning damage.
