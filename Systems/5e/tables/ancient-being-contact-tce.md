**Ancient Being Contact**

`dice: [](ancient-being-contact-tce.md#^ancient-being-contact)`

| dice: d6 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Employer**. An established member of local society acts as the interface between you and the patron and provides the cover of legitimate employment. They could be a bartender, shopkeeper, local official, or noble. |
| 2 | **Back-Room Dealers**. An exclusive area in an otherwise-ordinary establishment requires a password or token to gain entry. There you meet and communicate with shadowy agents of your patron. |
| 3 | **Magical Message Drop**. Magically recorded messages from your contact or your patron appear in odd places. You know to check a predetermined location, such as a crack in an ancient monolith or a specific grave, for instructions. |
| 4 | **Visions**. Your patron doesn't use intermediaries, instead speaking to you in dreams, omens, or visions. The being appears in your mind as you sleep, taking control of your dreams to deliver instructions that become difficult to ignore. |
| 5 | **Ephemeral Echo**. Your contact never physically reveals itself to you. Perhaps it is the ghost of a dead person, an entity that appears outside the flow of time, or a projected illusion of a being that never leaves your patron's hidden sanctum. |
| 6 | **The Mouthpiece**. The ancient being's voice whispers through the lips of an ordinary person. You patron might posses the body of a stranger or a party member to converse with you. |
