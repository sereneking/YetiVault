# Sea Fury

## Lair actions
_Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount_

A sea fury lurks in the caverns where its coven once dwelled, decorating the walls with the bones of its slain kin, as well as baubles stolen from sunken wrecks.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sea fury can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects, but can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Caverns, tunnels, and pools of water within 120 feet of the sea fury become foggy or murky, to the extent that the area becomes heavily obscured.  
- The sea fury conjures a 15-foot cube of water that fills an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it, then moves the water in a straight line up to 60 feet, after which the water disperses. Any creature that comes into contact with the rushing [wave](/Systems/5e/items/wave.md) must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) by it and pushed 15 feet along its course.  
- The sea fury calls forth the spirit of a dead sailor or sea hag that met its end in the lair. This spirit has the statistics of a [specter](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/specter.md) and lasts until the sea fury uses another lair action. The specter appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the sea fury and obeys the sea fury's commands.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Explorer's Guide to Wildemount_

The region containing a sea fury's lair is warped by the sea fury's magic, which creates the following effects:

- Sea water within 5 miles of the lair becomes coarse and choppy, as if whipped by an unseen wind.  
- Sea grass within 1 mile of the lair is imbued with a foul mockery of life, grasping ineffectually at any creature that passes within 5 feet of it.  
- Ordinary [crabs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/crab.md) and [octopi](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/octopus.md) within 1 mile of the lair grow in size to become [giant crabs](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-crab.md) and [giant octopi](/Systems/5e/bestiary/beast/giant-octopus.md), respectively. These creatures serve the sea fury as spies and guards.
