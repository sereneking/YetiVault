# Helm of Perfect Potential
*Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)*  


This copper-hued helm contains a shard of the Elemental Chaos embedded in its forehead, surrounded by a motif of a rising sun. Legend says Annam fashioned this helm for his daughter Diancastra to hold the fragment of chaos she used to prove her worth to her father.

## Random Properties

The helm has the following random properties, determined by rolling on the appropriate table in the Dungeon Master's Guide:

- 2 [minor beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-beneficial-properties.md) properties  
- 1 [major beneficial](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-major-beneficial-properties.md) property  
- 1 [minor detrimental](/Systems/5e/tables/artifact-properties-minor-detrimental-properties.md) property  

## Master of Guile

While wearing the helm, you have advantage on Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks.

## Arrow of Elemental Havoc

As a bonus action while wearing the helm, you can launch a bolt of searing elemental energy toward a creature you can see within 90 feet of yourself. The target must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `4d6` acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (your choice). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

## Spellcasting

The helm has 6 charges and regains `1d6` charges each dawn. As an action while wearing the helm, you can expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20): [elemental weapon](/Systems/5e/spells/elemental-weapon.md) (1 charge), [call lightning](/Systems/5e/spells/call-lightning.md) (2 charges), [wall of fire](/Systems/5e/spells/wall-of-fire.md) (3 charges), [conjure elemental](/Systems/5e/spells/conjure-elemental.md) (4 charges), [tsunami](/Systems/5e/spells/tsunami.md) (5 charges).
