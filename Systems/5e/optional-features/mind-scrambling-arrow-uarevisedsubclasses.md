# Mind-Scrambling Arrow
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Subclasses p. 4*  

Your enchantment magic causes this arrow to temporarily beguile its target. Choose one of your allies within 30 feet of the target. If the arrow hits a creature, the target takes an extra `2d6` psychic damage, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or it can't attack the chosen ally or include that ally in a harmful area of effect until the start of your next turn. This effect ends early if the chosen ally deals any damage to the target.

The psychic damage increases to `4d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
