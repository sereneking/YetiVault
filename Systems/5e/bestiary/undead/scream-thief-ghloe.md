# Scream Thief
*Source: Grim Hollow: Lairs of Etharis p. 14*

## Salvage

The bones of a mortal transformed into a scream thief remain imbued with its undead aura. A skilled magic item crafter using 200 gp of magical regents, and spending at least 5 days of effort, can create a [wand of silence](/Systems/5e/items/wand-of-silence-ghloe.md) (see Appendix A of Lairs of Etharis) if they succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check.

A spellcaster can capture a psychic fragment's essence before it dissipates after death. The spellcaster requires a container worth at least 100 gp. Anyone who succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence ([Arcana](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) check can capture a portion of the defeated psychic fragment. The container can store up to 10 hit die worth of undead essence for 8 hours before they dissipate.

As an action, a container holding this spiritual essence can be thrown up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. All creatures within 5 feet of the broken container must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. A failed saving throw results in `1d4` necrotic damage per hit die of essence stored, while a success deals half as much damage.

## Lore

- **DC 10 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The scream thief is immune to necrotic and poison. The incorporeal nature of psychic fragments makes them resistant to nonmagical weapons.  
- **DC 15 Intelligence ([Religion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Religion)).** The touch of a scream thief drains life that magic cannot heal; only time and rest can.  

A scream thief remains trapped in its place of death, often accompanied by spirit fragments of the creatures it has killed.

## Traits

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The scream thief can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions

***Life Drain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`4d8`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

***Silence the Living (Recharge 5-6).*** The scream thief forces a humanoid within 30 feet of it to make a DC13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target takes 19 (`3d12`) psychic damage, is [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened), and is unable to vocalize a sound of any kind. The target may repeat the saving throw at the end of its turns to end these effects. On a success the creature takes half as much damage and is not [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) or silenced.

## Reactions

***Fragment the Spirit.*** The scream thief targets a creature that died from one of its attacks. The target's spirit rises as 3 (`1d6`) psychic fragments in the space of its corpse or in the nearest unoccupied space. The psychic fragments are under the scream thief's control.
