# Githzerai Anarch

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

An anarch can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the anarch can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the anarch can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The anarch casts the [lightning bolt](/Systems/5e/spells/lightning-bolt.md) spell (at 5th level), but the anarch can change the damage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or thunder. If the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it doesn't ignite flammable objects.  
- The anarch casts the [creation](/Systems/5e/spells/creation.md) spell (as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed substance of Limbo instead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object remains until the anarch's [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) is broken, regardless of its composition. If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from the object, its [concentration](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#concentration) breaks.  
- The anarch can magically move an object it can see within 150 feet of it by making a Wisdom check with advantage. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing an anarch's lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- In Limbo, the anarch can spend 10 minutes stabilizing a 5-mile area centered on it, causing the unformed substance to take whatever inanimate form the anarch chooses. During that process, the anarch determines the shape and composition of the forms created.  
- The anarch stabilizes any object created in Limbo and brought to the Material Plane for as long as the anarch remains within 1 mile of it (no action required).  

If the anarch dies, these effects end after `1d6` rounds. All formed substance becomes a chaotic churn of energy and matter, unraveling into unformed substance that dissipates `1d6` rounds later.
