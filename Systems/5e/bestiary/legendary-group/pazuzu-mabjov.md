# Pazuzu

## Lair actions
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Pazuzu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Pazuzu can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Pazuzu opens a portal and summons forth `1d4` [perytons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/peryton.md) or [gargoyles](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/gargoyle.md).  
- Pazuzu casts [insect plague](/Systems/5e/spells/insect-plague.md) but does not need to concentrate to maintain it. The insects inflict 33 (`6d10`) piercing damage.  
- Pazuzu telepathically speaks to all creatures within 120 ft. of him and offers each what they most desire. Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Charisma saving throw or forfeit their next action as they contemplate the decision. A good-aligned target may voluntarily fail the saving throw and forfeit their action to agree to Pazuzu's terms. If so, and if he has the [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell available, he will cast it as long as he sees no immediate negative consequence to his doing so. Pazuzu does not suffer any of the negative effects of casting the [wish](/Systems/5e/spells/wish.md) spell.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy_

The region containing Pazuzu's lair is warped by his presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- A warm, sickly sweet wind blows briskly within one mile of Pazuzu. Each day, upon first encountering this wind, every creature must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or immediately vomit, suffering 14 (`4d6`) necrotic damage. Those that failed the saving throw are also [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) for one hour.  
- Any flying creature of CR 2 or less becomes twisted after a day spent within 6 miles of Pazuzu. If not already evil-aligned, they become so. Flying insects, birds, and other flying creatures will harass any other creatures moving through the region, slowing movement by one half.  

If Pazuzu dies, the effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
