# Giant Shark Skeleton
*Source: Sleeping Dragon's Wake*  

A giant shark is 30 feet long and normally found in deep oceans. Utterly fearless, it preys on anything that crosses its path, including whales and ships.

The giant shark skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The shark has had skeletal feet attached by some demented necromancer.
