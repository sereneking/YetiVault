# Lizardfolk Render
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 241, Storm Lord's Wrath, Infernal Machine Rebuild*  

Filled with the primal magic of Semuanya, the lizardfolk render undergoes terrifying changes during a dayslong ritual performed by a shaman. As seen in Danger at Dunwater, the render's claws grow long and hard as steel, its frame enlarges, and its temperament becomes even more ferocious.
