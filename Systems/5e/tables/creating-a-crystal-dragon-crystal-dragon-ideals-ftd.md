**Crystal Dragon Ideals**

`dice: [](creating-a-crystal-dragon-crystal-dragon-ideals-ftd.md#^crystal-dragon-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Exploration. Yesterday is already known. Today is for something new. (Chaotic) |
| 2 | Empathy. It's a gift to share in another's joy, even if sometimes you must bear their pain, too. (Good) |
| 3 | Hospitality. We all live beautiful livesâ€”it would be a shame not to share our lives with others. (Neutral) |
| 4 | Determinism. Our destinies may already be written, but the way we achieve them still matters. (Any) |
| 5 | Fun and Games. Play is learning, but without the boredom. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | Control. Everyone is welcome, as long as they follow my rules. (Lawful) |
