# Hemocraft
*Source: Tal'Dorei Campaign Setting Reborn p. 165* 

Two of the subclasses in this book, the cleric's Blood Domain and the wizard's Blood Magic arcane tradition, use the magical art of hemocraft. This involves using your own blood and the blood of other creatures to heal, hex, and even bend bodies to your will.

## Blood and Session Zero

Self-harm and the removal of agency can be an incredibly sensitive topic, regardless of whether it's happening to someone's own character, to another player character, or to an NPC. Additionally, many people have blood phobias that they may not want to disclose. Because of this, if any player or the GM wants to use one of these options, it's important that you bring it up in a pregame "session zero" and get everyone's affirmative and enthusiastic buy-in. These options are exciting and flavorful, but the comfort of your group is essential to making the game fun for everyone.

## Blood and Spellcasting

If everyone in your group is okay with using blood magic in your game, consider how you can describe your spellcasting in fun and eerie ways. When casting divine spells as a Blood Domain cleric, you can flavor your descriptions to tailor the magic's effect on an opponent's blood and vitality. The [hold person](/Systems/5e/spells/hold-person.md) spell might involve locking a target's body into place from the circulatory system out. [Cure wounds](/Systems/5e/spells/cure-wounds.md) might feature lines of blood knitting lacerations together like a needle and thread. As a Blood Magic wizard, your [find familiar](/Systems/5e/spells/find-familiar.md) spell could conjure a horrific crimson spirit of congealed ichor and pulsing veins. Have fun with the theme!

## I Don't Have Blood!

Some characters don't have blood. It might be because they're a living construct, or have become undead through some macabre magic. If you want to play a blood mage but don't have blood yourself, consider your hemocraft to be a unique variant that channels the power of your life force, the necromantic energy that animates you, or even the oil that pumps through your artificial form. This is a purely flavorful change, and doesn't affect any of your subclass features.

## They Don't Have Blood!

On the other hand, some hemocraft features require the targets of your magic to have blood themselves. It's generally up to the Game Master to decide what does and doesn't have blood, but for the most part, all beasts, dragons, giants, and humanoids need blood to live. Most celestials, fey, and fiends have blood or magical ichor, as well as some elementals. However, constructs and undead don't have blood, and are unaffected by hemocraft.

Most aberrations, monstrosities, and plants also need blood or some type of vital sap or ichor to survive. It's recommended that the Game Master rule in the players' favor in cases like these. That said, one way to show that hemocraft is more difficult to use against such creatures is to give them advantage on any saving throw against the feature the character is trying to use.
