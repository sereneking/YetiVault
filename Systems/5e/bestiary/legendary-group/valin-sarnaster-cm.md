# Valin Sarnaster

## Lair actions
_Source: Candlekeep Mysteries_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Valin takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; Valin can't use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Each undead creature in the lair can pinpoint the location of each living creature within 120 feet of it until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Each undead in the lair has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead creature that tries to cast a spell of 4th level or lower in Valin's lair is wracked with pain. The creature can choose another action, but if it tries to cast the spell, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `1d6` necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.  

## Regional effects

Valin's tomb is warped in any of the following ways by the creature's dark presence:

- Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other nonmagical drinks are spoiledâ€”wine turning to vinegar, for instance.  
- [Divination](/Systems/5e/spells/divination.md) spells cast within the lair by creatures other than Valin have a 25% chance chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a [divination](/Systems/5e/spells/divination.md) spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.  
- A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a [remove curse](/Systems/5e/spells/remove-curse.md) spell or other magic.  

If Valin is destroyed, these regional effects end immediately.
