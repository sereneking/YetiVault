**Terrible Secrets**

`dice: [](things-best-left-unsaid-terrible-secrets-ai.md#^terrible-secrets)`

| dice: d6 | Secret |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Before taking your paladin oath, you accidentally publicly humiliated a good friend. You have sworn to make it up to them, despite them wanting nothing to do with you. |
| 2 | You took another person's identity to escape the law in your younger daysâ€”and quickly came to realize that this person was far cooler than the real you. If anyone finds out your true identity, your reputation will suffer. |
| 3 | You were the child of nobles who were found guilty of stealing vast sums from their subjects. If your identity is discovered, you might be hunted down. But you might also be in line for a massive inheritance. |
| 4 | You once belonged to an organization that was eventually banned because a typo in its name made it appear seditious. If anyone discovers this, you run the risk of being mistaken for an enemy of the realm. |
| 5 | You made a deal with a fiendish creature to escape trouble or save another character's life. Emissaries of this fiend appear occasionally to tell you that the paperwork regarding the debt you owe is temporarily lost, but they're working on it. |
| 6 | You owe an enormous amount of money to a forgetful and amoral person. So far, that person has made no sign of wanting you to repay the debt, and you have no idea what to do about that. |
