# Fear
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet cone)
- **Components:** V, S, a white feather or the heart of a hen
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) for the duration.

While [frightened](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#frightened) by this spell, a creature must take the [Dash](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Dash) action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
