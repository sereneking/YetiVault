# Warrior of Madarua
*Source: Quests from the Infinite Staircase p. 220*  

Warriors are the foot soldiers of the faction. They thank Madarua for each battle they see and train daily with spears to follow her to victory.

## Warriors of Madarua

Members of the Warriors of Madarua wear bronze masks that depict the determined the face of Madarua, an ancient Cynidicean god of birth, death, and the seasons. Each member bears a small tattoo of a sickle on the inside of their left wrist.

Warriors of Madarua recognize and respect the ever-changing complexity of life. In combat, they strive to be as fierce and unpredictable as nature itself.
