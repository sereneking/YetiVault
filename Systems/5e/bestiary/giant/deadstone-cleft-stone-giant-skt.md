## Traits

***Olach Morrah.*** The giant meditates for 1 hour, during which time it can do nothing else. At the end of the hour, provided the giant's meditation has been uninterrupted, it becomes [petrified](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#petrified) for 8 hours. At the end of this time, the giant is no longer petrified and gains tremorsense out to a range of 30 feet, as well as a measure of innate spellcasting ability for the next 24 hours.

***Stone Camouflage.*** The giant has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The giant's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

**1/day each**: [stoneskin](/Systems/5e/spells/stoneskin.md), [time stop](/Systems/5e/spells/time-stop.md)

**3/day each**: [meld into stone](/Systems/5e/spells/meld-into-stone.md), [stone shape](/Systems/5e/spells/stone-shape.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The giant makes two greatclub attacks.

***Greatclub.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+9` to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (`4d10 + 6`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).

## Reactions

***Rock Catching.*** If a rock or similar object is hurled at the giant, the giant can, with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, catch the missile and take no bludgeoning damage from it.
