# Bear King

## Lair actions


On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Bear King takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Bear King can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Quake.** A minor quake starts on a point the Bear King can see within 120 feet of him. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or take 7 (`2d6`) bludgeoning damage and fall prone.  
- **Summon Bees.** The lair's denizens rise up to defend their king, causing `2d4` giant bees (use the statistics of a giant wasp) to appear in unoccupied spaces of the Bear King's choice within 60 feet of him. The bees act on initiative count 20, are allies of the Bear King, and obey his spoken commands. The bees remain until the Bear King dies or until he dismisses them as a bonus action. The Bear King can have no more than eight giant bees under his control at one time.  
- **Ursine Transformation.** One creature the Bear King can see within 30 feet of him must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or transform into a brown bear as if the creature had failed a saving throw against the polymorph spell. While transformed, the creature must move to and attack a target chosen by the Bear King on each of its turns. The transformation lasts until the Bear King dies or until he uses this lair action again. The transformed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the transformation on itself on a success.  

## Regional effects


The region surrounding the Bear King's lair is warped by his magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- **Angry Bees.** Bees within 10 miles of the Bear King's lair are easily agitated and quick to attack Humanoids that aren't bearfolk or werebears.  
- **Call of the Bear King.** Within 5 miles of the Bear King's lair, creatures have disadvantage on saving throws made to avoid contracting lycanthropy from a werebear.  
- **Heightened Passions.** Emotions within 10 miles of the Bear King's lair run high. Arguments quickly descend into physical scuffles and enjoyable get-togethers are likely to become raucous carousing.  

If the Bear King dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
