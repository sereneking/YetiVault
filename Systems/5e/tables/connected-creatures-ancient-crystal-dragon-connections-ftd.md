**Ancient Crystal Dragon Connections**

`dice: [](connected-creatures-ancient-crystal-dragon-connections-ftd.md#^ancient-crystal-dragon-connections)`

| dice: d4 | Connected Creatures |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | A clan of dwarves has discovered a self-renewing vein of quartz near an [ancient crystal dragon's](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) lair. The dwarves mine the area aggressively, unaware that the dragon is spying on themâ€”and intends to demand recompense at some point in the future. |
| 2 | An [ancient crystal dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) is stalked by a villainous ranger who has already claimed a dozen draconic trophies. |
| 3 | An [ancient crystal dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) follows a pod of whales from one sea to another, having grown fond of the valuable ambergris they leave in their wake. Now whalers are scheming to kill the dragon. |
| 4 | A community of seal hunters reveres an [ancient crystal dragon](/Systems/5e/bestiary/dragon/ancient-crystal-dragon-ftd.md) as the spirit of their glacier home. Such worship amuses and flatters the dragon, who keeps the hunters safe and leads them to locations where seals are plentiful. |
