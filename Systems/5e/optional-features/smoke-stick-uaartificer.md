# Smoke Stick
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Artificer p. 5*  

As an action, you can reach into your Alchemist's Satchel and pull out a stick that produces a thick plume of smoke. You can hold on to the stick or throw it to a point up to 30 feet away as part of the action used to produce it. The area in a 10-foot radius around the stick is filled with thick smoke that blocks vision, including [darkvision](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#darkvision). The stick and smoke persist for 1 minute and then disappear. After using this formula, you can't do so again for 1 minute.
