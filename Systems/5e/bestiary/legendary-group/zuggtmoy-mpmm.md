# Zuggtmoy

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- **Rally Plants.** Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack.  
- **Summon Fungi.** Zuggtmoy causes four [gas spores](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/gas-spore.md) or [violet fungi](/Systems/5e/bestiary/plant/violet-fungus.md) to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour.  
- **Unleash Spores.** Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- **Corrupted Nature.** Within 6 miles of the lair, all Wisdom ([Medicine](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Medicine)) and Wisdom ([Survival](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Survival)) checks have disadvantage.  
- **Fungal Infestation.** Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase.  
- **Mutating Vegetation.** Vegetation within 1 mile of the lair becomes infested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed.  
- If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of `1d10` days.
