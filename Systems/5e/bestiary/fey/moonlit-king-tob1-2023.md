# Moonlit King
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 176*  

*Dressed in archaic nobleman's finery, this elf lord has wildly unkempt bluish hair and pale, almost luminous skin. His eyes bulge slightly from their sockets as they stare vacantly. The lord's shadow moves slightly out of sync with his body, which appears solid in some portions and nearly transparent in others*.

His Lunar and Royal Majesty, Ludomir Imbrium the XVI, is also known as the Moonlit King of the Shadow Fey, Lord of Shadows, Duke of the Elves, and Master of the Winter Palace. A creature consumed by madness, the Moonlit King is an ephemeral vestige of greatness lost. He barely lives in reality anymore, and he is beset by phantoms from his own mind conjured from shadows and regret.

## Dwindling Power

The Moonlit King lost the favor of his wife, the Queen of Night and Magic, long ago. When he fell from power, the Queen exiled him, banishing him from his seat in the courts of the shadow fey. Now he endures in the crumbling, far-flung Tower of the Moon. The King has sunk deep into madness during his isolation and has turned to bargains with demons and devils in a desperate bid to regain freedom.

## Fey Lords and Ladies

Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings. However, despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.

### Heads of State

The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's domain, in his or her eyes, a fey ruler's word is law. Outsiders might not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

### Vacant Thrones

When a lord or lady of the fey dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the stations of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.

## Moonlit King's Lair

The Moonlit King's lair is the Tower of the Moon, which is hidden in a spiral labyrinth deep within the Plane of Shadows. The tower is a run-down, forlorn place filled with false whispers and shadow ghosts of the mad fey lord's own creation.

## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Moonlit King fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

***Moonlit Weapons.*** The Moonlit King's weapon attacks are magical. When he hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra 14 (`4d6`) radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Spellcasting.*** The Moonlit King casts one of the following spells, requiring no material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (save DC 19):

**At will**: [continual flame](/Systems/5e/spells/continual-flame.md), [invisibility](/Systems/5e/spells/invisibility.md) (self only), [moonbeam](/Systems/5e/spells/moonbeam.md), [zone of truth](/Systems/5e/spells/zone-of-truth.md)

**1/day each**: [heal](/Systems/5e/spells/heal.md), [project image](/Systems/5e/spells/project-image.md)

**3/day each**: [dispel evil and good](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md), [dispel magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md), [major image](/Systems/5e/spells/major-image.md)

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The Moonlit King makes three Crystal Staff or Moon Bolt attacks. He can replace one attack with a use of Spellcasting. If two Crystal Staff attacks hit one creature, the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be [stunned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#stunned) until the end of its next turn.

***Crystal Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+11` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`2d6 + 5`) bludgeoning damage plus 14 (`4d6`) radiant damage.

***Moon Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* `+11` to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (`4d10 + 5`) radiant damage, and the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius until the end of its next turn. If the target is a creature in a form other than its true form, it takes an extra 11 (`2d10`) radiant damage and must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or revert to its true form.

***Animate Shadows (Recharge 5-6).*** The Moonlit King causes the shadows of up to three creatures he can see within 60 feet of him to animate and attack their owners. Each target must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 49 (`14d6`) necrotic damage, and its Strength score is reduced by `1d4`. On a success, a creature takes half the damage, and its Strength score isn't reduced. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. The creature dies if this effect reduces its Strength to 0.

***Summon Devil (1/Day).*** The Moonlit King magically calls a lunar devil to aid him. The devil arrives in `1d4` rounds, acting as ally of the Moonlit King and obeying his spoken commands. The devil remains for 1 hour, until the Moonlit King dies, or until the King dismisses it as a bonus action.

## Bonus Actions

***Moonlight Step.*** The Moonlit King teleports, along with any equipment he is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see. The origin and destination spaces must contain moonlight.

## Reactions

***Shadow Slip.*** When a creature the Moonlit King can see within 30 feet of him attacks him, he takes on the quality of his manifest delusions, temporarily becoming ghostly. The attack roll has disadvantage, and if it hits, the Moonlit King takes only half the damage from the attack.

## Legendary Actions

***Move.*** The Moonlit King moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Shift Moonlight.*** The Moonlit King changes the brightness of each area of moonlight he can see within 120 feet of him from dim light to bright light or vice versa.

***Attack (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Moonlit King makes a Crystal Staff or Moon Bolt attack.

***Spread Madness (Costs 2 Actions).*** Each creature within 30 feet of the Moonlit King must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or suffer short-term madness. The Moonlit King can use this legendary action only when he is in moonlight.
