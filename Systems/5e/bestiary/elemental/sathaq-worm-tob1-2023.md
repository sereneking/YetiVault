# Sathaq Worm
*Source: Tome of Beasts 1 (2023 Edition) p. 317*  

*This titanic worm's rocky hide is rough and hard as stone. Its yawning gullet writhes with miniature worms like itself.*

## Elemental Predators

Sathaq worms are nightmarish predators from the Plane of Elemental Earth with rugged brown hide embedded with stones. They devour stone and flesh with equal ease.

## Guts Filled with Larvae

Sathaq worms are solitary; they approach each other only to mate. Their young incubate inside the worms' gullets. Creatures they swallow are simultaneously digested by the parent worm and devoured by the larvae.

## Painful Presence

Ultrasonic noise and magical ripples that tear at flesh and bone make the very presence of a sathaq worm extremely uncomfortable for creatures of the Material Plane.

## Traits

***Agonizing Aura.*** The sathaq worm emits ultrasonic noise and minor vibrations that cause pain and subtly disrupt the functions of most creatures. A creature that starts its turn within 15 feet of the sathaq worm must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on attack rolls until the start of its next turn. Creatures with resistance or immunity to thunder damage automatically succeed on the saving throw.

***Earth Glide.*** The sathaq worm can burrow through nonmagical, unworked earth and stone. While doing so, the worm doesn't disturb the material it moves through.

***Earthen Camouflage.*** The sathaq worm has advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide in sandy, muddy, or rocky terrain.

***Siege Monster.*** The sathaq worm deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The sathaq worm makes one Bite attack and two Slam attacks, or it makes three Slam attacks. It can replace its Bite attack with a use of Swallow.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (`4d8 + 6`) piercing damage, and the target is [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), and the sathaq worm can't Bite another target.

***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+10` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`3d8 + 6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Swallow.*** The sathaq worm makes one Bite attack against a Large or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is [blinded](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#blinded) and [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the worm (including the worm's Agonizing Aura), and takes 10 (`3d6`) piercing damage and 10 (`3d6`) acid damage at the start of each of the sathaq worm's turns. The sathaq worm can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the sathaq worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the sathaq worm must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone) in a space within 5 feet of the sathaq worm. If the sathaq worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#prone).
