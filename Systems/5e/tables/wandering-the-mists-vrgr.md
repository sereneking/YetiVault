**Wandering the Mists**

`dice: [](wandering-the-mists-vrgr.md#^wandering-the-mists)`

| dice: d100 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 01–20 | Characters emerge in a domain of your choosing. |
| 21–40 | Characters wander the Mists for another `1d6` hours, then roll on this table again. |
| 41–65 | Characters emerge from the Mists on stable ground `1d100` feet away from where they entered. |
| 66–75 | Characters emerge on stable ground a mile from where they entered the Mists at midnight of the night after they entered the Mists. |
| 76–85 | Characters emerge from the Mists inside a structure somewhere within the domain they tried to leave, perhaps a cave, crypt, shed, or closet. |
| 86–95 | Other creatures appear within the Mists. Roll any die. If you roll an even number, a lost and terrified [commoner](/Systems/5e/bestiary/humanoid/commoner.md) appears. If you roll an odd number, `2d6` [skeletons](/Systems/5e/bestiary/undead/skeleton.md) or 1 [unspeakable horror](/Systems/5e/bestiary/monstrosity/unspeakable-horror-vrgr.md) (see "chapter 5") appears. After the encounter, another `1d6` hours pass, then roll on this table again. |
| 96–99 | Characters emerge from the Mists where they entered to find the domain changed. Perhaps someone the characters knew is gone, and no one has any knowledge of them ever existing. |
| 100 | Characters emerge from the Mists on a world on the Material Plane. After `1d6` hours, the Mists rise around them once more. Roll again on this table. |
