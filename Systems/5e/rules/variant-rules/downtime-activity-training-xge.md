# Downtime Activity: Training
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 134* 

Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.

## Resources

Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek.

## Complications

Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10% chance chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table.
