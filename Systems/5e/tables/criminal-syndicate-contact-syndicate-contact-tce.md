**Syndicate Contact**

`dice: [](criminal-syndicate-contact-syndicate-contact-tce.md#^syndicate-contact)`

| dice: d6 | Contact |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Personal Mentor**. This longtime member of the syndicate took you under their wing when you were young and became a parental figure. |
| 2 | **Clever Urchin**. An innocuous person, perhaps a beggar or menial laborer, knows all the right people and shares their connections with you. |
| 3 | **Former Law Enforcement**. Your contact used to be (or maybe still is) a member of local law enforcement. They have sharp insight into the law's workings in your area and a healthy dose of paranoia for that reason. |
| 4 | **Bon Vivant**. The boss of a local den of vice—whether gambling, narcotics, or other pleasures—aids you when they're not distracted by their own debauchery. |
| 5 | **Traitor**. You know your contact in the syndicate has betrayed it, but they have enough clout and leverage that you don't dare cross them—yet. |
| 6 | **Criminal Royalty**. Unknown to most, your contact is a member of local nobility or royalty. Why they maintain relations with the syndicate is a troubling mystery. |
