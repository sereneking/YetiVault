# Environmental Elements
*Source: Wayfinder's Guide to Eberron p. 8* 

Combat can feel very mechanical. *I move 10 feet. I make an attack roll. I use a reaction.* One way for the DM to encourage more cinematic action is to present a list of Environmental Elements. In a tavern, this list could include Chandelier, Plate Glass Window, Roaring Fireplace, Tray of Drinks, Drunk Patron. If you're fighting in an ancient tomb the list could be Pile of Gold Coins, Scattered Bones, Rotting Tapestry, Moss-Covered Statue. Each turn, a player can work one of these elements into their description of their action. The primary purpose of this is to give players ideas; interesting details to use while describing their actions. But if a player comes up with a particularly clever way to use an element, the DM could grant advantage on a check or attack roll, or some other benefit. The rogue needs to cross a room full of enemies and wants to swing on the chandelier? As the DM, I'd let them make a simple Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check to avoid opportunity attacks, essentially getting a free [Disengage](/Systems/5e/rules/actions.md#Disengage) action.

Environmental elements are always  optional and largely cosmetic. As a DM, you  don't have to grant a bonus for every use of an   element. But presenting a list can help players  think of the location as more than just squares  on a map and challenge them to add more  cinematic flair to their actions.
