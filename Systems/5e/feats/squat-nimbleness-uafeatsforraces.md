# Squat Nimbleness
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Feats for Races p. 4*  

**Prerequisite**: [Dwarf](/Systems/5e/races/dwarf.md), [Gnome](/Systems/5e/races/gnome.md), or [Halfling](/Systems/5e/races/halfling.md)

You are uncommonly nimble for your race. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your walking speed by 5 feet.  
- You gain proficiency in the [Acrobatics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Acrobatics) or [Athletics](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Athletics) skill. If you're already proficient in the skill, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any check you make with it.
