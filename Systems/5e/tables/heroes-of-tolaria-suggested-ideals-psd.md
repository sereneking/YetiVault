| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | **Teaching.** Tolaria is a school where the world's most promising wizards can learn from masters of their craft. |
| 2 | **Restoration.** Every day, lost knowledge is regained and devastated lands are renewed. It's our duty to use our magic to help this effort continue. |
| 3 | **Responsibility.** Following the philosophy of the Academy's original headmaster, Barrin, I am dedicated to keeping powerful magic out of the hands of those who would abuse it. |
| 4 | **Innovation.** Like the ancient artificer Urza, I believe progress comes through bold and radical new design. |
| 5 | **Progress.** Like the kind Tolarian chancellor Rayne, I believe progress comes through careful iteration and measured experimentation. |
| 6 | **Self-Improvement.** Like Urza's brother Mishra, I believe that the improvement of the body through genetic and artificial modification leads to the general improvement of humanity. |
