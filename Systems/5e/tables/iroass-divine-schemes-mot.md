**Iroas's Divine Schemes**

| dice: d4 | Scheme |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Iroas inspires a brave Akroan general to travel forth with a handpicked army and confront the forces of a powerful and supposedly vulnerable minotaur warlord. The general loses despite Iroas's favor, and Akros is left exposed and poorly defended before a wave of Mogis-worshiping minotaurs. |
| 2 | Heliod, weary of the constant strife between Iroas and Mogis, swears an oath to destroy Mogis with a godly coalition behind him. Erebos, disgusted with Heliod's hubris, forms a group in support of Mogis. Iroas, rather than accepting Heliod's aid, launches a grand campaign of his own against his brother. |
| 3 | Mogis arms one of his champions with an axe capable of sundering the souls of mortal creatures. Iroas wants his champions to procure the weapon so he can lock it away in his armory and thwart his brother. Agents of Erebos also seek to recover the weapon on their master's behalf. |
| 4 | Iroas achieves the victory he has always pursued: he kills his brother, and the world falls into chaos. |
