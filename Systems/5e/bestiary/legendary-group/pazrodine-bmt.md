# Pazrodine

## Lair actions


The entire Seelie Market is Pazrodine's lair. Pazrodine's challenge rating is 22 (41,000 XP) when she's encountered in Seelie Market.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties) while in her lair, Pazrodine can take one of the following lair actions; she can't take the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- **Banish into Dream.** Pazrodine targets a creature she can see within 120 feet of herself and attempts to send that creature to a dream plane. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be banished to a harmless demiplane until initiative count 20 on the next round. While there, the target has the stunned condition. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space.  
- **Overwhelm the Senses.** Pazrodine targets up to three creatures she can see within 30 feet of herself. The sounds, sights, and scents of the market intensify for these creatures, overwhelming them with bright colors, echoey chatters, and sweet smells. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the incapacitated condition until the end of its next turn.  
- **Whirlwind of Fruit.** Fey fruit flies out from nearby carts, creating a whirlwind of fruit in a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 60 feet of Pazrodine until initiative count 20 on the next round. When a creature enters the whirlwind's area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
