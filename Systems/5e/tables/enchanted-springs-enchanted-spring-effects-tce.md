`dice: [](enchanted-springs-enchanted-spring-effects-tce.md#^enchanted-spring-effects)`

| dice: d12 | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 | Any creature that touches or drinks the water of this spring feels blessed. The creature gains the benefits of a [bless](/Systems/5e/spells/bless.md) spell for 1 hour. |
| 2 | Bathing in the spring covers a creature with a glowing coat of golden feathers. While the creature isn't wearing armor, the feathers grant a +1 bonus to AC. The feathers vanish after `1d4` days. |
| 3 | A creature that touches or drinks the water of this spring develops an overwhelming desire to sing. Every sentence the creature speaks for the next 24 hours rings with lyrical splendor, which grants it advantage on all Charisma checks. |
| 4 | Bathing in the spring grants a creature the benefits of the [greater restoration](/Systems/5e/spells/greater-restoration.md) spell. As a side effect, the creature's skin, hair, and eyes become a shimmering golden color for `1d4` days. |
| 5 | Bathing in the spring grants a creature the benefits of the [spider climb](/Systems/5e/spells/spider-climb.md) spell for 24 hours. |
| 6 | A creature that touches or drinks the water of this spring grows the tail of its favorite animal. The tail is not under the creature's control; it moves or reacts to emotions. The tail vanishes after 24 hours. |
| 7 | Any creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher that touches or drinks the water of this spring gains advantage on Wisdom ([Insight](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Insight)) checks and can cast the [detect thoughts](/Systems/5e/spells/detect-thoughts.md) spell once, requiring no components. The effects of the spring fade when either the spell is used or 24 hours pass, whichever happens first. |
| 8 | Bathing in the spring causes `1d10` flowers to grow from a creature's head. The flowers smell lovely, and they renew their vitality and scent every day. The flowers vanish after 7 days. |
| 9 | A creature that touches or drinks the water of this spring grows `1d4` eyestalks. These eyestalks let the creature see in all directions and grant it advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight. The eyestalks vanish after `1d4` days. |
| 10 | Bathing in the spring causes a creature's voice to sound sinister. For the next 24 hours, the creature's voice grants it advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks and disadvantage on Charisma ([Deception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Deception)) and Charisma ([Persuasion](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Persuasion)) checks. |
| 11 | A creature that touches or drinks the water of this spring grows a set of donkey ears. The ears grant the creature advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/Systems/5e/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on hearing. The ears vanish after `1d4` days. |
| 12 | Bathing in the spring causes a creature to develop a third eye on its forehead. The eye grants the creature [truesight](/Systems/5e/rules/senses.md#truesight) out to a range of 60 feet. The eye vanishes after 24 hours. |
