**Outlands Elementals**

`dice: [](outlands-elementals-mpp.md#^outlands-elementals)`

| dice: d4 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 | [Water elementals](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental.md) travel in a group that looks like a long, wandering river. |
| 2 | Some skull-headed [azers](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/azer.md) have been influenced by "the Nine Hells". They escort a heavily armored caravan of rare ore to the gate-town of Ribcage. |
| 3 | A wounded [mud mephit](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/mud-mephit.md) asks the characters to help it deliver a sealed package to a leader in a nearby gate-town. |
| 4 | A wealthy [dao](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/dao.md) that glistens with gemstones has been influenced by "Arborea". It leads a parade of glimmering [galeb duhr](/Systems/5e/bestiary/elemental/galeb-duhr.md) between gate-towns as part of a shopping spree for precious rocks. |
