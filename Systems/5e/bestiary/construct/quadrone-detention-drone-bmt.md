# Quadrone Detention Drone
*Source: The Book of Many Things p. 135*  

Detention drones vary in size, strength, and shape, though most are shaped like some kind of mechanical animal or plant.

## Traits

***Axiomatic Mind.*** The drone can't be compelled to act in a manner contrary to its nature or its instructions.

***Disintegration.*** If the drone dies, its body disintegrates into dust, leaving behind its weapons and anything else it was carrying.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The drone makes two fist attacks or four shortbow attacks.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+3` to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (`1d4 + 1`) bludgeoning damage.

***Shortbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+4` to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`1d6 + 2`) piercing damage.

***Detention Orb.*** The drone launches a tiny orb of magical force at a creature it can see within 30 feet of itself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be encased in the orb, which expands to a size just large enough to contain the creature. While encased, the creature doesn't need to breathe, eat, or drink, and it doesn't age. Nothing can pass through the orb, nor can any creature teleport or use planar travel to enter or exit the orb. As a bonus action, the drone can move the orb and its contents up to 30 feet in any direction. A successful casting of the [Dispel Magic](/Systems/5e/spells/dispel-magic.md) spell on the orb (DC 15) destroys it. The orb otherwise remains intact until the drone spends an action to end the effect or the drone is destroyed. A drone can have only one detention orb active at a time; if the drone creates a detention orb when it already has one active, the first orb disappears, freeing the creature inside.
