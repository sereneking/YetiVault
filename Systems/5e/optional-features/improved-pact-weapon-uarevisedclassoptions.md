# Improved Pact Weapon
*Source: Unearthed Arcana: Revised Class Options p. 6*  

**Prerequisite**: Pact of the Blade

You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells. In addition, the weapon counts as a magic weapon with a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is already a magic weapon that you transformed into your pact weapon.
