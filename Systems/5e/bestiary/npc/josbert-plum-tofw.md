## Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** Josbert has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of Josbert's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition.

## Actions

***Electrified Mancatcher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+5` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`1d10 + 3`) piercing damage plus 4 (`1d8`) lightning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it has the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition (escape DC 13). Until the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition ends, the target has the [restrained](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#restrained) condition and can't teleport, Josbert can't make Electrified Mancatcher attacks, and the target takes 8 (`1d10 + 3`) lightning damage at the start of each of its turns.
