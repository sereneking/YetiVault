| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I employ a polysyllabic vocabulary that conveys the impression of tremendous erudition. |
| 2 | I'm used to helping out those who aren't as smart as I am, and I patiently explain anything and everything to others. |
| 3 | I often get lost in my own thoughts and contemplation, becoming oblivious to my surroundings. |
| 4 | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help itâ€”I'm a perfectionist. |
| 5 | I want to know how things work and what makes people act as they do. |
| 6 | There's nothing I like more than a good mystery. |
| 7 | Messing up just means an opportunity to learn from my mistakes. |
| 8 | There's no need to rush into action; I prefer to plan before I act. |
