# Radiance
*Wand, unknown (magic) (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  


While holding this wand, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls. In addition, you ignore half cover when making a spell attack. Radiance is in the form of an exquisite golden hand mirror.

While surrounded by darkness, it sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius. A creature that is attuned to Radiance can use a bonus action while holding the mirror to cast the [enhance ability](/Systems/5e/spells/enhance-ability.md) spell, choosing itself and no other creature as the spell's target. Once this property of the wand is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
