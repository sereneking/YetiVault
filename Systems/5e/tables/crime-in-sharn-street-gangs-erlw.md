**Street Gangs**

| Gang | Description |
|------|-------------|
| The Broken Mirror | Khoravar half-elves who often target elves with acts of violence, frequently disfiguring their victims |
| The Brokenbridge Brawlers | Brelish veterans who antagonize Cyrans and former soldiers from other nations |
| The Eyes | Collection of odd individuals who paint symbolic eyes on their clothing and armor and claim to see things others cannot (in fact, they are a cult dedicated to the daelkyr [Belashyrra](/Systems/5e/bestiary/npc/belashyrra-erlw.md) and serve a hidden beholder) |
| The Five Faces | Changeling pickpockets who work Middle Menthis |
| The Gremlins | Gnomes and halflings who specialize in illusion magic |
| The Little Fingers | Child pickpockets active in Middle Dura (their leaders are adult halflings loosely allied with the Boromar Clan) |
| The Mourners | Cyran veterans who present themselves as a vigilante militia that protects Cyran refugees, but some say they're just pursuing selfish interests |
| Muut | Bugbears in Lower Dura who have been "protecting" Malleon's Gate for decades (recently they've aligned with Daask, but their focus is their home district) |
| The Quiet Folk | Goblins who live in the sewers below Tavick's Landing and avoid violence, using stealth and knowledge of the sewers to pull off their thievery |
| The Red Jackals | Primarily shifters and half-orcs who live in the sewers below Menthis and clash with anyone who invades their territory |
