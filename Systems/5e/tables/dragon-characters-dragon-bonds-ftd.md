|-----------|------|
| 1 | I treasure one particular item in my hoard—a gift from a person I loved, who is long since dead. |
| 2 | I am close to my siblings, whose lairs are nearby. I would go to great lengths to protect them—or avenge them. |
| 3 | A nearby person intrigues me with fascinating questions and bizarre ideas. |
| 4 | I collect information about the worlds of the Material Plane, and I would love to visit another world someday. |
| 5 | I am devoted to Bahamut or Tiamat and put their interests ahead of my own. |
| 6 | I'm determined to destroy the adventurers who slew my parent—and everyone connected to them. |
| 7 | I'm obsessed with attracting the attention of another dragon. |
| 8 | I feel an obligation to protect the creatures that inhabit my territory (except the ones I eat). |
| 9 | I am trying to collect an extremely rare set of priceless treasures. |
| 10 | I won't rest until I retrieve an item stolen from my hoard. |
