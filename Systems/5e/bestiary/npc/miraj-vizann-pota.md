# Miraj Vizann
*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 198*  

Miraj is an earth genasi from Calimshan. He is a perfectionist who oversees the Black Earth cult's tunneling operations and specializes in magic and alchemical processes that shape stone. He also has an affinity for the element of water and styles himself a 'mud sorcerer.'

Though he is the most accomplished spellcaster in the Cult of the Black Earth, he has no interest in challenging Marlos Urnrayle for leadership. He knows that he is no match for the medusa and is happy to pursue his experiments while Marlos leads.
