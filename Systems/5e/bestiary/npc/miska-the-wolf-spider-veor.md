# Miska the Wolf-Spider
*Source: Vecna: Eve of Ruin p. 247*  

Miska the Wolf-Spider is a legendary demon lord and master of battlefield strategy. He has the lower body of a massive armored spider, four arms, and two enormous wolf heads that drip poison. Yet Miska's greatest strength is his cunning mind.

## History

Ages ago, Miska led the hordes of Chaos against the forces of Law at the behest of his patron, the enigmatic Queen of Chaos. It seemed Miska's domination couldn't be stopped.

In desperation, Miska's opponents crafted an artifact to bind him in an extraplanar prison. This rod broke apart after sealing him in Pandemonium, scattering across the planes and becoming known as the Rod of Seven Parts. The rod is the key to releasing Miska from his long imprisonment.

***Multiattack.*** Miska makes one Lupine Bite attack and two Trident of Chaos attacks.

***Lupine Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* `+13` to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`2d10 + 6`) piercing damage plus 27 (`6d8`) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or have the [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) condition for 1 minute. While [poisoned](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) in this way, a creature has the [incapacitated](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated) condition and can't regain hit points.
