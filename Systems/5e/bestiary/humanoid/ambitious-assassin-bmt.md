## Traits

***Legendary Resistance (2/Day).*** If the assassin fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two Poison Blade attacks.

***Poison Blade.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* `+7` to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (`1d4 + 4`) piercing damage plus 5 (`1d10`) poison damage.

## Reactions

***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker the assassin can see hits the assassin with an attack, the assassin halves the attack's damage against it.

## Legendary Actions

***Cunning.*** The assassin escapes nonmagical restraints and ends the [grappled](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#grappled) condition on itself, then moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Stab (Costs 2 Actions).*** The assassin makes one Poison Blade attack.

***Vanishing Escape (Costs 3 Actions).*** The assassin creates a sudden distraction, such as a cloud of disorienting smoke or flash of dazzling light, filling a 10-foot cube within 5 feet of the assassin. Each creature of the assassin's choice in that area takes 9 (`2d8`) psychic damage, and the assassin has the [invisible](/Systems/5e/rules/conditions.md#invisible) condition. This invisibility lasts until the end of the assassin's next turn.
